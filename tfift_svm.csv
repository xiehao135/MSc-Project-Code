"Ten people killed in attack at offices of satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo, Paris prosecutors say http://t.co/czyz6voZTw"," Islamophobia? This is the future of Europe. Thank you. I'm sure it has nothing to today with Islam. holy shit Mag firebombed in '11 re Mohammed cartoon row MT Ten killed in attack at Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo This is not Islam (if they are muslims). This is the European stupidity. Thanks again. let me guess??? Something to do with Islam?? The religion of peace followed by the peaceful followers and advocates?? Islamophobia is justified when 99% of terrorist attacks are carried out by people promoting islam Fuck political correctness. Violent ideologies have violent consequences. It's time we acknowledged the truth. Faith is the excuse given for believing in things without sufficient evidence. It is irresponsible and dangerous. The end of the world is near,I foresee it Don just assume it has everything to do with Islam how do you get these stats? Make them up? It's an observation. And obviously exagerated. But you can't deny that recent violence stems from Islam. That's nonsense. This is just a sign of extremist madmen. so ISLAMOFASCISM then ? I'm no expert. I'm just pointing out the majority of recent violence comes from Islam So it's a reasonable assumption to suggest islamic extremists are behind this one doesn't need to be an expert to notice the obvious. I didn't deny that, I just want people to be careful with spreading these kind of rumours No one should feel entitled to special treatment. Especially when they think irrational violence is acceptable. The West needs to wake up and understand Islam is at war with us The west would rather worry about Kardashian's ass or how men sit on subways. I find it cute that the far left is still tweeting about that pipe bomb in Co Springs The EU took Hamas off the terrorist list. Of course the west doesn't fucking care. Indeed. Only the suffix, 'phobia' is unjustified, as it implies irrationality. I saw that what a few weeks ago?Cause a genocidial terror group can b reasoned with Well thanks for that rational contribution there, bub. Yeah, that works out real well.  They'll respond with more appeasement, though. Western Europe governments are PC to the end. Ask the Jews of Warsaw how well that worked out.If u can find any The one who truly rules is the one you are not allowed to offend. Sucks that we have freedom of expression as a human right in the West.We r so horrible Freedom of expression is worthless if we are afraid to use it though. Don't live in silence.Try to show others it's ok to speak your mind Exactly. Will fear be the response to this tragedy? Bingo. All rights on paper are worthless if you can't exercise them. The understatement of the year. not from islam for sure, but from stupid fanatics who happened to be muslims You've massively contradicted yourself there what a BS statement dear Chery. Any idea about this question? I forgot Christians aren't illegally invading countries and using drones to kill innocent people This has nothing to do with Christianity. Christians go to church on Sundays and are peaceful. I think you'll find that the UK that YOU LIVE IN attacked EXTREMISTS to protect itself ""illegally"",""innocent""?  In your view. It a whole new debate. Stay on the current subject.. You Got Some Thanks Memes On Your Twitter Man Haha, No Hard Feelings Just Debate :) indeed! Those RADICALS have a plan to change the face of EUROPE! dark? Just funny and some truths regarding Zionism I agree, but, our governments have their responsability. I'm tired about their ""just crazy people"". Dank : slang ; ""an expression for something of high quality."" :) if modern Christians were like modern islam they would not be allowed to show father ted lol islam is bloody nuts indeed! Governments and people should wake up before it is too late. Yep. How? The fanatics are Muslims, The thing they are fanatical bout is Islam. There is a definite link. so many apologists for Islamofascism. All claim that 1000s of attacks have nothing to do with Islam. BS. is the issue Islam or the liberals who have allowed this Islam protection in the west? both.",1

Islamists object to this. Breaking update: They use any excuse or no excuse at all. They are simply barbarians. Unquenchable bloodlust. : Terrorism is used to inflict FEAR and Foreboding into its' victims or targeted populations. In the Parisian publisher attack, 11 people have died so far. That's quite clear. They riot by the millions over a bloody cartoon. Kill rape destroy. Some god they have It is all about control. And EVERYONE is the victim/target in Islam. BENGHAZI ugh i live in paris Awful! Police say 11 now dead in ""carnage"" at CHARLIEHEBDO HQ in Paris   (Cc) They target areas known to have gun control Or just plain blow them up.

You say??   You are the ignorant one. yes considering what happened in the past if you know any history it's few actions 1.2 billion followers of Islam. All intelligence fro around the world says that 15-25% of islam is radicalized. That's between 180-300 MILLION MOSLEMS. Where are the so called peaceful ones?? Where? I never see them protesting Bravo u got 1/4 the fact read more u'll find out that the other 75% Try educating yourself. U may learn something.

I can give you chapter-and-verse on Islam AND terrorism. Don't waste my time. Me to! üëç Sounds ignorant when you say ""THEY are all barbarians."" Always room to learn more YOU sound ignorant as HELL. You are wasting my time with your bullshit. BYE. ALL islamists are terrorists or back them. If that is her pic, I more than twice her age. Waste of time. Muslims are peaceful, not islamists. Um, what is a Moslem? I like to differentiate the two. That is how I do it.

Got the following: They are the same. The end. Agree with many things you say just not this one. THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND THE AYATOLLAH ARE GOOD?? You are nuts. MB are being squashed by the Army.  I do not speak for MB. You have bought the ""peaceful Islam"" myth and the ""Shia=good""... The people in Iran are good, not the leadership. ...""Sunni=bad"" myth. Don't have time to teach you. See you later. I had a sunni roomate in my younger years.  great guy. The MB ORIGINATED in Egypt, and if you believe in ""moderate"" ... ...Moslems, you are beyond help. Good day. MB are not the peaceful Muslims I speak of. The ones who chant ""Death to America"" or the ones who chant... ...""Death to Israel""? I believe in secular Muslims. Long live Israel and it's people. There.are.none.taqiyya.goodbye. yeah ‚ù§Ô∏è its heartbreaking what happened Why mute me?  Just cause I disagree with you on one thing doesn't mean we should not follow one another. Islamists smear the religion, people converting to Islam... and lot of people around the world are ignorant. Islamists and Muslims are 2 different things. Keep telling yourself that. Is that the NEW PC narrative now?? Go fuck yourself I won't go f*k myself, it's a joke ? Believe what you want poor you. No. Poor U that U follow Satan &amp; a baby Raper.

Horrendous story from Paris - 11 shot dead + many wounded at offices of satirical mag #CharlieHebdo that published cartoons of Muhammad.," they also go after druglords and gangsters, do you have any actual evidence that they are even linked yet? thought not. Racial Islam is getting out of control. follow me please religion of peace once again the religion of peace rears it's ugly head. you don't see jews or catholics murdering people for making jokes and anti-semitic, obviously they don't at all deserve to be killed but why would you take the risk of a reaction with a cartoon like that? More Like Islam at Work. fuck off. that's not about islam been to Northern Ireland lately? racial is depicting someone a particular religion hold dear in a idiotic way who really gives a fuck? It could be the prophet Dave for all I care, point is people have been killed. Twonk. when was the last time an IRA member executed loads of kids in a school because they were learning? Free speech gives people the right to do so. always an excuse. ; thats just horrible.this is not the way to honour our prophet who was a man who advocated peace amongst man. free speech also must be cautious of tolerance, free speech  doesn't give the right to insult other religions If you think guns are the reason, you are a fool. The culprit is Islam. because of freedom I don't know, they were probably too busy planting nailbombs in pubs and cars or executing police answering 999 calls. I do agree but it's your people throwing tantrums because your feelings got hurt. Live with it or fuck off. although speaking of killing kids.  ring any bells? So enough of the holier than though bullshit thanks. free speech by definition does Who married a 6 year old and raped her at 9. the people who attacked that building, even IF they are Muslim, no more represent their faith than the IRA do Catholics Yes it does. Mockery is important, ridiculing daft beliefs is important. religion is an extremely delicate subject. Its belief and a lifestyle. Insult that and you make enemies extremely delicate for you. Everyone else doesn't have to adhere to how you feel well not everyone one thinks like you do in the west.  The whole world isn't in the west Just because it is a delicate subject does not mean that it should be ignored. Guess what? France is in the West. Well here, I respect people but not their beliefs if they don't warrant respect. Simple. nobody is forcing you to be like us. You don't have to respect us BUT BE TOLERANT OF US!!! no we see worse ... Remember the Norwegian catholics who killed about 100 in a youths camp ? He was labelled 1/2 yes it is. West isn't necessarily a geographical region If you want to be tolerated, learn to tolerate gays, women, Jews, and Christians. says who? We aren't out killing people. Is that more noble than printing a picture? I wouldn't go out of my means to insult Christianity.  I've get better things to do. This pple had an ""agenda"" as a psychopath... But if they are even muslims who might have dont it, they are extremist and terrorist !! I'm respectful of all people irrespective of sexual orientation,  religion,  and race Just accept people you will get your feelings and 'prophet' trodden upon.. Doesn't mean you get.. But your religion is not to throw tantrums and murder innocent people..if you were so comfortable in your religious faith.. You wouldn't care what anyone says about Islam. Simple. in the US this is carried every couple of month !! But they are catholics and so they're sick and nt terrorist An Agenda? In comic satire? People poke fun at all religions, you just can't take it because it's yours. don't misunderstand me.NOT all muslims are terrorists. but at the moment all terrorists seem to be muslims oops. Israel? Northern Ireland? Id challenge Islam because it is a violent religion in its most basic form. Same with Christianity. That Agenda Being Islam. I think at your age you know that western media has got an agenda muslims religion and individuals are separate entities he was a lunatic. isis is a group that target vulnerable people because they can't fight back they need more of an agenda. RELIGIONOFPEACE thats bcz the media labels any attack carried out by muslims as a terrorist attack !! But any attacker who isnt is considered a sick person !! In the us school shootings and cop killings happens every couple of months but bcz The media in our countries does whatever means necessary to protect Islam from criticism. I doubt you've read on islam or read the Quran. Making accusations on things you don't know about is ignorance they r nt carried out by muslims ... They r nt terrorist attacks !! Exactly, which is why I do not tolerate your religion. Why do so many verses call for death? once again they are lunatics who don't quote 'god is great' evidence? look at there targets. beslan. school in pakistan ,river of blood in syria, kidnapping of young girls in nigeria but do u consider them as terrorists ?? why dont u consider isis as lunatics bcz they are !! i know all their crimes ... Is it really different from mass murdering children at a youths camp ?? BECAUSE THEY HAVE STATED IT IS FOR A NEW ISLAMIC STATE!!! like i said, i know not all muslims are murderers all people who commit acts that terrorizes should be called terrorist and nt only the muslim ones we are arguing about 2 different points NO!! but most of those are condemned . the likes of ISIS seem to get more recruits every day .is that right? i am a muslim and i know isis are terrorist and i cant and neither cant my religion explain their action but what i am saying is that other people who arent muslims who commit act of terrorism such as killing kids i agree. IRA ,boko haram,taliban, ISIS, neo nazis are all classes of terrorists. and what do you think about these recruits ?? Who are they ?? Arent they the irakis who were bombarded and their families killed by the US for some oil ?? Aremt they Afghanistan people who had millions of their countrymen and although i hate to admit ... But u r partially correct ... Unfortunately a big part of the terrorist attacks people are joining ISIS and invading a muslim country, murdering women +kids yet blame the west. no difference are carried out by muslims but they radicalized after western attacks on their homes and families but the middle east has always been at war with itself. my question is why can't people just accept each other? i dont blame the west and i certainly dont excuse their actions as terrorists but i might understand their radicalization at war with itself ?? How is that ?? : Whatever makes you makes you  happy. Thank god I live in South Africa and not the UK. Muslims here live in peace look at your own country's history and you'll see how sill you sound so whatever happened to evolution? are we still stuck in the dark ages? why can't people accept not everyone is the same? who's we, the dark ages is a period of time specific to Europe only, you know? you reply makes no sense whatsoever wth? The IRA wasn't fighting for Jesus. A religion that instructs the murder of any follower that chooses to leave it is obviously evil. no, they were fighting 'for' the Pope against the British Crown, in their eyes anyway. Islam should be forbidden in the west as it's an ideology incompatible with our beliefs. this is the 21st century. are human beings not evolving at all? are we still sacages who'd rather kill than live Where did you learn that foolishness? I do hope you didn't pay for it. It wasn't the Irish Papal Army. DERP yes, in short we are exactly that. People are murdered and beaten every day that doesn't make headline news. and the only thing evolving is our means to carry out those same attacks. should we ignore the poor innocents in syria just so we don't harm any of the ISIS 'volunteers' ? no, it wasn't,  but as far as many people were concerned it might as well have been. Much like al qaida belive. no.  I supported action in Syria as it happens most wars are started by a maniac who uses religion as their motive . absolutely. The problem we have though is others attacking all Muslims or Catholics or Jews because of a minority would be like me attacking all tv presenters because of the actions of Jimmy Saville and like you say, most people involved in things like this are maniacs, religion is just a convenient excuse. You're speaking ahistorical gibberish. Oh, btw: ""We have avenged the prophet!"" Your analogy would be apt if this were one attack by one person and not a long, wide pattern of jihad. what about Israel? what about israel? do they target women and children because they don't agree to a certain way? they target women and children because they don't want them on land they believe is theirs, but isn't. I agree! I go to Israel 3 times a year! Massively the innocent party! That was a rhetorical question Bullshit. Wake up. Read up or shut up. Hamas Fatah Hezbollah amongst others want Israel wiped off the map TERROR honestly Harry. You are embarrassing yourself. Media swayed. Read up the factual historical background. easier to support a perceived underdog. Forget that before Israel fired a bullet 10k rockets were fired israel! Saysitall no actually it doesn't!!!!!!! Wake up. look at land records. Read the mandates. The UN resolutions. Anyone can knock up a pretty graphic. jimmy Saville wasn't alone in his actions either, so my analogy is sound. Ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous. Much agreed. Have you ever heard of Timothy McVeigh? He was called a domestic terrorist! That's hilarious. This type of thing happens once every 20 years in France. Twice a year in the USA! nothing hilarious about people getting killed. You are a disgrace. seriously ?? U r gonna jump on a single exception ?? Olympic park bombing, weather underground, Sikh Temple shooting, etc., were all listed as terrorist acts! by whom ?? The government or the media and the people Some media, but all by the government. With this President many Muslim shootings haven't been called terrorism! i dont care about the govt !! The federal govt acknowledged that only 6% of attacks were carried out by muslims the point of difference was that if a muslim commits a crime most probably will be considered as a terrorist however if a person committing the same crime is NOT muslim most probably will be considered sick psycho That's because they haven't labeled all attacks by Muslims as terrorist acts! and i think this only started after 9-11 ... Not after mcveigh !! And that the media is to blame !! 2 Muslim attacks on military bases were called work place violence!! That's STUPID!! but the majority !! Even you have to admit that the media is biased about this !! After we saw the thousands of Muslims rejoicing in the streets at the murders!! what do they call christian attacks on schools ?? Just like the one carried out by taliban ?? Many attacks on our embassies and other embassies, 1st twin tower attack, USS Cole, but 9-11 final straw!! and millions of them condemning such violence !! how about we work the other way around two lets consider the US attacks on foreign soil !! Lets consider the foreign invasions !! Irak afghanistan ... What Christian attacks on schools? Where? Were they yelling Jesus is Great while they were doing it? i am sorry but how many innocent american was killed during all those attacks ?? Just a fraction of the innocents killed during the invasion of irak or afghanistan !! But you wont consider these innocent muslim people who were bombarded by your military !! i ddnt see the boston bomber yelling any religious words !! look ... Killers and psychos and from everywhere and every culture and every religion !! but one thing we can agree on is that the western media is biased against muslims !! And consequently so are western people!! Where are the hundreds of Christians rioting and killing for the defilement of Christ? why would they ?? As i believe they take this event proudly !! That's funny!! They were cowards that put bombs by children and walked away quietly!! however in islam we dont depict our prophet ... If you would like to mention our prophet then at least respect our religion So after making an accusation you should back up with evidence of Christian attacks on schools!! just like the coward person who shot and killed kids in cold-blood at schools not only at schools !! There are loads of examples !! The IRA the Norwegian attacker who killed 86 in a youth camp but u r from the US and the school shootings are the most things i thought you would relate to The real question is where have you ever seen thousands of Christians rejoicing for the killing of innocence? but it was never my intention to make accusations. I am merely demonstrating that psychos who kills people are everywhere and not only muslims This is true, but there are millions of Muslims that condone this and rejoice at the killings!! not millions !! These are only a few who were fed lies there entire lives !! it happened before with christians with religious white groups who killed black people and celebrated it !! but now these groups have almost vanished and i believe this will happen to the few extremists !! And they r few compared to all the muslims in the world who believe in the religion of peace just like me !! Or do you think i am a terrorist ?? Actually, I would NEVER agree with that! They rarely even mention that it was a muslim attack, especially regarding Israel! i am just happy we agree on the same concepts !! Perhaps i am too pessimistic!! But when it comes to muslims i have seen it all Most of MSM placates to Muslim extremist! Even this they're calling Islamaphobia, when phobia is irrational fear! some are really rational just like yourself whom i enjoy talking to learning how people look at us (muslims) trying to improve! IT'S NOT irrational fear when they actually kill you for satire and being an ""infidel""! but unfortunately there are also a few who would just insult me and would want to kill me !! Either way my response is the same I appreciate that, but you do need to know that acting at all like this was justified doesn't help. You seem reasonable too! We could have more world peace if we sought to understand each other better. its not justified and can never be explained and i am sorry if i gave you this impression !! Perhaps it was a misinterpretation I do know that there are peaceful Muslims, but not sure if Islam is a religion of peace. None of history shows that to be.",1
"French President Hollande condemns ""barbaric act"" after #CharlieHebdo gun attack kills 11 http://t.co/keuR4WvpHu http://t.co/vyuRvukz1N"," Terrorism has a religion. We know what it is. I pray to God they dont blame muslims. Because terrorism has no religion!!! they r waiting to identify the attacker's religion to decide whether to call him terrorist or a person with psychological probs And it's been flooding Europe for decades. Political class too scared to act. So electorate moves to the right. find the people that did this, then execute them in front of their families Europe is signing it's death wish by importing Muslims by the thousands every year. This one has. It's called Islam and the terrorists are conducting their attacks in Islams name. Can u please stop talking? Appearantly, u know nothing about Islam. French President Hollande condemns ""barbaric act"" after attack kills 11   RT I know far more than you. Even if I stop talking as you would like, it won't alter the truth. Because its not the truth. Every person who commits terrorist activities, are no true believer. okay well now i dont wanna go back to school i dont wanna get killed Whether they are christian, muslim or jew. Keep your head buried and you might just be allowed to keep it. And u are just one of those many people who are condemning all muslims. Generalising its called. Such a stupid comment can only come from someone stupid and ignorant. Unless they commit the act of terror in the name of their religion Then they are no true believers. Why cant u grasp this??? absolutely right üé© Whether they are or not, they believe it. Why can you not grasp that ? Ignorant, stubborn fool. The western world wont accept muslims. U have to wonder why. Are the a threat? To who and why? that has nothing to do with Muslims, its all about politics. Meanwhile Israel can throw fosfor on Palestinians and nobody says anything about it. U think thats real Won't accept them ? Muslims are the majority in many UK?Europe towns. What are you talking about ? U have a hard time staying polite? Well that says enough. U have to know that even muslim countries r attacked (and were attacked) by terrorists! Piss off with your crass stupidity. Muslims for religious reasons murder 11 people. Let them go to hell Then explain to me pls, why the world always blame muslims when something wrong happens The first lesson of discussing any issue is to know who u r, what u r and who do u represent, try 2 b polite üåπ You are an apologist for barbarians.   &lt; Here is why lesson2: the same people who r named ""muslims"" killed border guards in KSA last week, the victims were muslims!! it is better to think few centimetres deeper rather than being a parrot to whatever is said in the media! No of course it doesn't even if muslims did the shooting FFS I will look at it when I am home. Pls answer my question about Israel and phosphor absolutely class absolute mental awareness appreciate ur reply üé© killing 11 people for drawing Muhammed isn't Muslims?You're looking for empathy, I have none. Show me proof. Also, Israel has been under near constant attack from all Arabs since '47. Europe would rather die than give up being an inclusive society. I am looking for reality, while u r watching the media and copying what they r saying (1) Also, read Quran. It states violence against Jews and others is fine. Almost all world conflicts current involve muslims - guess it's coincidence simply, how do u know the reason is true and not made-up, especially with nowadays ISIS prob(2) You are an idiot go away. We¬¥ve had enough of Muslim violence and murder Fuck off you foul shit. No thats not true. Quran says, respect jews and christians it seems you're defending the terrorist attack, and condemning us. Typical. omg, well we dont get anywhere with this conversation finally, there are more than 1bn muslims in the world (go and learn statistics) or i can teach u You¬¥re mad. I absolutely condemn the attack and those who did it. Not only do we have the dead to worry about but their families. Its outrageous Not you, i just tkalking to Yayshamped Boko Haram, ISIS, Al Qaeda, etc, taught me all I need to know about your religion. So terrorism didn't/doesn't exist outside of Islam? Act by doing what? Here you go..Plenty more in Quran if you want to enlighten yourself. go back to my 1st comment and u will understand my main point (1) dear whoever, ISIS are attacking muslim countries too, just a simple example. Islamists were responsible. Most of their victims globally are Muslims. Turkeys don't vote for Christmas. Now u r escaping from offending muslims to condemning the attack. sorry John, I thought I replied to yayshamsaldeen. Must've hit the wrong one. comparably, just imagine if I claimed that all anti-islam are degeneratesüòä At this moment I doubt anyone could give a shit about offending muslims offending muslims is not offense üòä bcos the media has done enough offending them May God help you .. Who are you trying to persuade. Victim mentality, sod off somewhere where they have Sharia law Here here but anywhere other than Britain. Dont bother. I know quran. Probably more then you. My advice for u is. Read talmud. Thats a sick book very appropriate answer Ya that will fix the problem At this moment do you think anyone gives a shit You know nothing. The moderate muslims are those that deviate from the original. People like you are the root of the problem. You defend murder and atrocities and blame others I know nothing?? Please read the talmud, then come back with comments pls Thank you for insulting me. Again, read the talmud!!!! can you please remove me from this discussion THANKS Why? U cant handle the truth? READ TALMUD!!!! Then u know which book is sick!!! And who it belongs to. I'm sure they are not belong to any religion or may be they are some retarded person, isn't ? HOLYCRAP Limiting mass immigration by backward fascistic peasants with fantasy friends, who hate freedom. And if you're looking for a fight, look elsewhere &amp; grow up, not everyone obsessed with Harry Potter. Not everyone seeing dangers of mass migration is rightwing. I was fighting racism before you were a sperm. Anyone posing with that silly mask is a juvenile armchair warrior. I fought on the streets. thanks Dr. The most important thing in responding to the cold nerves and gentleness of creation, and God helps How would that prevent anyone (or any ethnicity) from being radicalised by say, downloading extreme material? And the majority of Muslims in the West were either born here or came here FOR freedom. Collective blame is wrong. 1 You don't know me, 2 Never said anything about right/left wing, 3 it's not about immigration it's about the ease with which... any1 of any background can be radicalised by extremists intent on spreading hate. Mass immigration happened to the Americas... to Australasia. What Europe has in comparison is not even close, &amp; most migrants are law abiding &amp; contribute positively. Sends A MESSAGE This collective blame on all Muslims or all immigrants for the criminal few IS bigoted. Deal w/ the ACTUAL perp, not all who... happen to have the same religion, ethnicity, nationality or skin colour. How come you want to speak to me but block me from replying?&gt; A true believer in free speech, aintcha. Too complex 4U. &amp; they have remained in multicultural ghettoes &amp; not integrated. Apartheid, I blame political class who created it. And you're wrong about most born here, they're still pouring in from Pakistan, tribals in a modern secular society. 1. No, you're anonymous! 2. No, but your intro page does. 3. It's ALL about immigration; 5 million in France alone. Germany 2, all EU So many really don't understand the concept of free speech. Immediately blocking anyone who disagrees with them, or worse, criticises Who mentioned ethnicity? You. I think you're a muslim hiding your identity and pretending yo're broad minded. No it doesn't. Just shows we are as barbaric as they are well what exactly do you propose? Diplomacy, harsh language, a slap on the wrist? not they all but only one. Do you know how many of us do not bother strict orders of Almighty Allah and his prophoet (PBHU) that... not to kill innocent in any circumstances.",1
"At least 12 killed in today's attack on satirical magazine #CharlieHebdo in Paris, official says. http://t.co/zUfxcG3Rfs"," Today we mourn with France but in the weeks to come France needs to do some soul searching and introspection Also security was abysmal and should have been heightened when so many threats had already happened towards this media agency Western leaders created terrorists with various Arabic ""springs"" by  mercenaries jihadists.It was INEVITABLE to go west. Disturbing. it was time . Cause no respect for any religion. If talk about Jews . It's anti semite.  If abuse Islam freedom of religionDeserve insulting others people faith cannot be called freedom of speech. Chief editor is one to blame. I Do not justify monsters-jail them Islamic terror. Empowered by media that makes excuses for it. Can't blame the Jews 4 this CNN. THIS is Islam and lots of deportation if state cannot control such irresponsible magazines making fun of people's faith then monsters come and do thejob.Face consequences Jews don't kill anyone if offended. Christians don't. Only these disgusting excuses for human beings. It's a CARTOON! Remember background: France, its Parliament &amp; Senate + some left-wgd municipalities bending over backwards to please Palestinians.. prophet moohammadd bedded horses,nothing more nothing less In France all Jewish official buldings including schools have to be tightly secured. Can't have police everywhere... dif between satire &amp; hatred. No Islamic sense of humor. Jihadists don't know what free speech means the real problem was letting these moooslims into the free world.ask politicans why we need them .moohammadd bedded MR.ED satire. Get it? Insults r free speech. Cowardice &amp; murder r not. Islamic terror is celebrated by its followers islam is not a religion its a brainwashed cult. true but when you mock a religion every day - one should heighten security Hearts and prayers for families of these police and journalists CH mocks all religions. Only one replies with assault rifles. + there were policement there. Killed too. u go to jail for anti semite.  Law. U can abuse any religion it's called freedom of speech. Be fair. It's hurtful There is no excuse - it is unacceptable always - we know in America how it feels they are discusting animals hehehe yah like Judaism Christianity and worst hinduism. This is what fools in churches call it. Because they are afraid Hey buddy, I'm insulting your faith. Now go fuck yourself. what freedom when you abuse a religion. These guys are freedom fighters for protecting Islam.  Why no law protect religio anti semitism, inciting hatred is VERY dif than satire&amp;humor. Jews don't kill u forcartoon. Inciting hate tho is crime but the priests,rabbis&amp; ministers don't preach(kill all non moooslims)  not yet  but lets hope we get it on.easy prey. Muslims feel they r being attacked everywhere not even their religion. These tend to happen. No protection what more hatred u want after abusing n Makin fun of the prophet. These guys who drew created hatred. Not attackers stay stupid and wait be the next victim.   such trash like u cannot blame monsters. U deserve be punished by monsters Muslims are being persecuted for their religion? In Pakistan, Nigeria or Paris? CHARLIEHEBDO I have to say though, the honesty about the murderous tenets of your religion is refreshing. CHARLIEHEBDO hehe u Jews are good by changing subjects.open another topic. We are talking of anti semitsm and anti islam u r not getting my point -monsters must be penalized.  But entire society need to be responsible and not provoke monsters look you fool we are talking revenge. If u abuse any religion . Revenge will be taken that simple free speech. They made fun of everyone! Only islamics kill ppl for a joke. A cartoon. A little offense. No excuse Bcoz they r killing people! Slaughtering. 'In the name of their prophet' no one else is doing that. its not islamaphobia to call an Islamic terrorist what he is. Muslims r silent &amp; won't stand up freedom fighters?? Fighting AGAINST everyone else's freedom. Go away that's the problem. Muslims are serious in their only and one true religion. They won't abuse of jesus moses or mohammed yeah? I'd like to see you respond this way to anti-Semitic children's programs on Gaza tv anti semitism results in ppl killing Jews. But Jews don't slaughter anyone for offensive cartoons infidels that r breathing offends these monsters. Freedom offends them. sorry not in name of Prophet.  In the name of God. Ezra to Jews is son of God. Just u guys r idol worship BS. NO other religion teaches that it's great to kill everyone else for whatever stupid reason islamics do you fool . We r not talking of Gaza. Anti semitsm and no laws anti protection of islam thanks tho for being honest about the Islamic excuses for murder don't think any1 is having trouble understanding what this is about. Kind if silly to compare this to anti-Semitism no it's ok to offend everyone else. Precious pedophile needs to be protected why are we not talking of Gaza, ya sidi? yes because islam is true religion. They don't take Bullshit from fools like Charlie Have died. pathetic waste of air. Thanks for showing the excuse for Islamic butchery lol the true all-embracing, multicultural attitude of ""moderate"" Islam comes out freedom of speech protects everyone. Islam just doesn't believe in freedom or democracy. Just death pedophiles is accepted in Judaism.  Read torah.  Who gave these fools right to make fun of Islam well if murder, pedophilia &amp; hate is ur true religion, then u deserve the hatred &amp; offense u get! Done w/u where is Islam protected under freedom of speech.  Show me any law. No law. So these guys right to kill lol moron I'm a rabbinical student. Don't tell me to find non existent things in the Torah it is a disgrace in Judaism. And christianity. It's applauded in Islam. Child rape pretending 2 b marriage reason forthis massacre is a concrete action of paper.not general principles of freedom. but it seems clear that you agree that the legitimate ISLAMIC response to the CHARLIEHEBDO satire was murder. üò∂ hatred pedophile and disgrace in Judaism . We as Muslims don't accept . What freedom if abuse Islam. Death do you live in an actual tent? And is your name Saladin or something come on Rabbis have wives as young as six. Hehehe. What is that not rape and pedophiles go away. Sorry excuse for human hehe Jews always change subject. If they lose cause of truth. Be serious. How many died under you in israel no it was Islamic teaching that freedom of speech is offensive to Islam, but killing is just dandy I have a lamp that I will sell you. If you rub it long enough a genie will emerge and grant you three wishes civilized countries have civilized laws that protect everyone. Islamics don't get 2 murder &amp; say defense heh heh Muslims always full of crap. What alternate universe you live in what civilization.  If you can abuse a religion and no law to protect any religion. So Muslims are guardians 11million arabs/Muslims killed by arab/Muslims since 1948. U r offended by eachother u r better expert.  I doubt but I am not expert.If so than my question why western govts tolerate all those Muslim groups don't make up stories. That is the way of Jews.  Always lying. There is it media . You cannot hide and lie. Killers I dont believe in any of them and certainly not worship them yup and all those Jews slaughtering kids in Pakistan and kidnapping schoolgirls in Nigeria I feel that the intellectual level of this discourse has kinda gone to hell no in Gaza and west banks. In pakistan Nigeria and Israel Netanyahu are same no difference easy just accept the truth and accept. You see abuse people not religion any where in the world. All religions this may come as a surprise to you but we and our fellow Jews...don't run the USA yeah i feel really sorry for them not sure what ur referring to. When Hamas brutally eliminates its rivals? Or uses kids as human shields arrggh! Can't... Defeat... The blinding light of 's logic!! depraved &amp; stupid. Go away islamics don't let us close our eyes. Ur too busy killing everyone. Even eachother lol. The ones that were faked? No pal massacres. No pal genocide. None of it is fact. Fool Hamas showed up in 1980s. Islamics sided WITH Hitler. Please read something truthful. U know nothing &amp; hurler didn't kick Jews out. He murdered them. That is what a real genocide is. Now go away. Done w/u ohhh so Hitler genocide and in Gaza not massacre.  Be truthful. U Jews always lie. Face the truth n justic bro thats hate not jews are bad I think its the zionist and far right who want to kill anyone who opposes appreciate your attempt at open-mindedness. But...keep trying although violent extremism in any form is undoubtedly bad. No matter which religion. We can agree on that so is free speach nor do I believe all Muslims are bad. I have encountered many friendly Muslims here in Israel but we must keep our dialogue honest. Appreciate you reaching out. Don't be afraid of ""Zionists"" they're not out to get you u imposed dictators stole raw material both in africa and middle east also in the creation of the zionist state it was a norm for jews to dress up as muslims and bomb people u heard it from me no muslim unless brainwashed will kill innocent people even if u abuse prophet settle down just came back from emirates,arabs r just fine its these brainwashed moooslims that r cause we stole it,ur shieks got all the money &amp; enslaved u &amp; ur women folk attack them u cowards. totally agree! Fortunately there are many not like this 'revenge' seeker that's ridiculous. Arabs in Israel r safe. Not so for ones that try to murder Israelis. Now move along go away. It's what arabs do lots &amp; lots brainwashed then. Seeing ur comments shows how widespread you,baboon,  US media rejected to reprint those pictures finding them insulting.So go and fuck yourself u stupid boy Hey buddy, I'm still insulting your faith and there's nothing you can do about it. Now go fuck yourself, loser.",1
"Gunmen at #CharlieHebdo's Paris HQ shouted they had ""avenged the prophet"", reports say http://t.co/1z7NtGWe5i http://t.co/IEWCMH7oUV"," they live to oppress, slaughter, and brainwash.... 2 highly trained gunmen oddly no concern about any vehicles coming down adjacent streets, balaclavas, body armor &amp; had an exit plan send in the special forces and send these muslim terrorist back to Allah! Rid us of them for good! WTF is wrong with people now a days?  These terrorists really irritate the hell out of me.  Damn bums always causing chaos. They were Muslim terrorists. Synagogues are Jewish. I doubt Muslims would kill 11 journalists to help the jews. IDIOT these muslim terrorists keep proving to us that they are cowardly scum of the earth! 12 innocents dead because of Islam!!!! All media globally should now print/broadcast CHARLIEHEBDO material in full that street from 2 angles oddly quietThen Hollande turns up at crime scene, security services have no idea where the gunmen are Terrorists don't represent Islam. Even the Koran it says to kill infidels and that martyring yourself is good. Islam is terror imo How come folks get Kalshnikovs when I was asked to switch on mobile, remove battery, remove shoes etc for a Transit Of course they do! Mental illness, poverty and religious fanaticism are the perfect combination for hatred. French gov are distinct from journalists. You can‚Äôt blame the French people for the action (or inaction) of their gov Absolutely senseless! Don't use the prophet as an excuse for your twisted ideology - ENDVIOLENCE Our freedom is NOT an option! These people are professional, no doubt. Who are nice? The French or the Terrorists? ""Avenged""? You idiots. All you have done is make more people hate Muslims. not because of Islam because it is a peaceful religion, but because of these individuals twisted beliefs but then again you seem ignorant judging by your tweets, so there really is no point in trying to discuss this w you yes it seems so ....... plenty of evidence to back you up on that what makes you think i want to discuss islam with you? Mohammed can fu*k off - Islam is like a cancer that needs treatment fast!! I was right ;) yes you were......... nicely taken out of context. I could very easily take some very violent verses out the bible and judge Christianity you cannot defend islam....the world has stopped listening - its only the libtards left to lick your arses if your beliefs are true, where is the billion-strong Muslim army destroying everything in it's path? I told you there's no point discussing, you're ignorant and I can't change what you think It's a very small number of extremists damaging the reputation of the entire religion you sound a bit paranoid. Billion strong army? You mean a billion Muslims, the large majority of which are peaceful the number is not as small as you think..... dont be fooled the media certainly help with that too. What about extremists in Christianity like the westboro baptist church? Shall I judge Christians based on that? where did you hear this? The all-so-reliable media? Thought so It was sarcasm. There is no army. I was making a point to this deluded racist. I do, I mean the only atheist like this is Richard Dawkins, and even then he's only a bit of a dick, not an extremist oh my, sorry mate. I thought you were talking to me Very sad situation however be careful what you say sad pathetic racist. why must I be careful what I say? islam is n wil remain to be a peaceful religion hate or love it am proud to b a muslim Nah, I'm on your side here buddy, haha or perhaps it's not as great as you think.. Do you want me to believe the majority of Islam followers wants to kill me? Good for you! you must travel your own road.................... I thought it was obvious you're being offensive you dumb fuck. I really dont care if I offend you........In fact I'm glad I offend you :-D so let Islamists travel theirs you idiot, and don't judge a billion people based on the actions of the extremists. good bye Wing Nut I am not 1 of the liberals that worries about offending muslims who have nothing better to do than complain.so fu*k U &amp; Mohammed! The world is full of sad racist scumbags like you.. But there's line you shouldn't cross. bro as we Muslims we are taught not to hurt anybody in anyway unless they hurt us you know that for you saying the f word to our prophet we should all just knock on your house and kill you but we are also taught to give everybody a chance do u see any Muslim accept these individuals saying any thing to Christians feel free to come and gibe me a knock......just make sure you have health insurance The smalles in contradiction you are fucking bastard he only fav 1 part from the conversation now i would love to kill you know you can just read half the words i said i said we should not just go knock on your door and kill you like some individuals we need to leave you alone read all tweets why should you come and kill me? Who says you should do that? you are saying the f word to our prophet i am telling you the real muslim will not kill you like you think i am muslim that is saying these stupid bastards did not avenge the prophet but made him look like the worst man ever who told you you should come to my house and kill me? Where does that instruction come from? Please answer that for me i do not mean that ..i mean the tourists who claim to be muslim think that they should kill i am saying ...... if they do that they are not muslims if you kill an innocent person you can not be a muslim you're not answering thje question - who said you should come to my house and kill me? where does that instruction come from the leader of the not muslim tourists but i say again they are the one who are supposed to be killesD should I answer for you? The qu'uran say that doesn't it? The so called religion of peace......... ok ok now the leaders of the non muslim tourists but plz do not talk about holy books because i can also talk about it Islam isn't a race you brainless idiot okay then, what word should I have used? sensible is the word you should have used ""deluded sensible""? And you're calling him brainless? You could. But the Koran specifically says to do these things. I would know, I've read it in World Literature *sigh*. It seems you actually know nothing, you believe that gays should be hung and you're gonna call me stupid? Congrats two versus that represent the whole book. GG's dude. BUT SCHOLAR WHO HAS A DEGREE IN ALL THINGS RELIGIOUS I don't, but last I heard westboro baptist church absolutely loathe gay people. And the biggest twist? They aren't muslims! you have to have studied the whole thing, but we are on twitter so unfortunately I can't screenshot the whole Quran, genius. Same or I would post the 75+ versus that say ""kill them because they don't worship Allah."" that's a verse, yes. What exactly is your point? I will have fun proving your ignorance My point, is you can't say a blatant verse stating to ""kill them wherever you find them"" (US, EU, ME) is taken out of context... yes I can because you still don't understand judging by how you still take things out of context. read the article. I'm pretty sure you'll still be ignorant even when you see the truth but I guess thats not my problem I suppose it really means sit down and talk to unbelievers about what it means to serve Allah? If you don't like my opinion on the subject. By all means, block me account so you don't have to see it. your opinion is fine, the ignorance not so much. If you read the article you'd understand the context and why it was said So he replaces the word ""them"" with ""idolaters"" and that makes it okay? Yes the bible said kill idolaters but only he without sin can cast the first stone. and I'm pretty sure it wasn't God who said that it was man. you still havent caught on. At the time Muhammed and followers were being tortured and constantly attacked. defending themselves seems pretty rational and justified, wouldnt you agree? Said what? That idolaters should be stone. they may loathe gays but at least they don't hang them.Your point is invalid you said that I believe gays should be hung, I said I don't? How is my point invalid? don't deny the truth go to any Islamic country and say you're gay and they will kill you you aren't answering my replies that disprove yours and now you're changing the topic to stoning? No, I'm sorry I only saw the other reply. I'll go back and read the other replies. Defense vs going to another country in another time and killing possibly innocent people is different. War could be justified then, but when they set off bombs at a marathon or kill reporters in Paris its uncalled for. it is forbidden in the Quran to be gay. It is forbidden in the bible too and punishment for it there is also death. Yes you're right, the US government and extremists do do this often. As well as the jews in Israel killing palestinians the difference is Christians don't actually do it we dont know if boston marathon was a hoax by government and in both it was a case of extremists, not true followers of islam Yes, apparently they don't follow what God wants them to do, the God they claim is all knowing exactly because they realise that it is stupid if you choose to believe in God/a religion you cannot just hand pick what of it you want to believe in also this discussion is time consuming and going nowhere. Let us agree to disagree and be done with it :) agreed.....faze4life",1
"Eyewitness: terrorists said, ‚ÄúTell the media that this is al Qaeda in the Yemen‚Äù before attacking #CharlieHebdo http://t.co/dTaPFkFr5F"," was right after all. In the graphic video of the CHARLIEHEBDO attack (which I will not post) the terrorist speaks in RUSSIA|n. Video Via UKRAINE omg Yes, I know. Wish I hadn't watched it, but I heard the Russian clear as day Certainly didn't mean to imply you shouldn't have posted it- just re-read my tweet and hope it doesn't appear that way. I just didn't want others who might be upset by it to see if :) Thanks for the info! and we confirmed. Thats Russian language. And without accent Fuck Russia Yes, it is- no accent whatsoever. They were Russian. CHARLIEHEBDO UKRAINE So, not Chechen? Dagestani or Chechen quite possible, they could speak Russian clearly too thanks for the clarification Agreed There are also known Russian nationals who joined ISIS from Tatarstan and other Muslim regions I want to listen to it again, but can't watch it again :( this video captured some clear vocals - it sure sounds like it. probably best not to its horrific they need hanging by their balls for a week I can't watch it or listen again. But, to me, it was very clear. heard all their (ISIS) top brass is Chechen? The policeman right there. Horrid there is like a Chechen regiment size of a company there I think. Top brass - no way Not all, but there are Chechens and Dagestani, - and reports that most cruel of kk i hear it (russian), and i have native fluency in it. But, it's a job for experts, not regular internet users... you are right Ania just trying to raise awareness important point Agree. I hope this gets investigated, now after Crimea, after MH17, u can't surprise me w what horrid crap Putin does Do you guys speak french to make a proper assessment ? Because it sounds very much like french. ""Tu veux nous tuer ?"" ""Nan c'est bon chef"" Do you speak Russian to make a proper assessment? A bit. But I'm also native french, and it sounds like french. ""Tu vous nous/le tuer ?"" ""Nan c'est bon chef"" I think we're on the same page... Important to post it... need someone who speaks both languages fluently to give their opinion Think we need someone who speaks both languages fluently True. But let's keep a fair amount of skepticism meanwhile Correction : I meant ""Tu veux nous/le tuer"" (""You want to kill us/him ?"") ""Non c'est bon chef"" (""No it's good sir"") yes but good to publicize both points of view then at least one can be discounted Agreed. It's possible they switched to French- but I heard Russian At what point ? I'm certainly no language expert, but it was quite audible to me Very beginning after first shot, I think - can't bring myself to watch again Surely French authorities are analyzing audio PT ""Appears to speak"" - language expert obviously needed to confirm ""Don't touch him,he's done"" in RUSSIAN Did you listen to it? yes Thisturb the link i tweeted from FB originally tweeted by  is an excerpt so not too graphic I had to stop the feed after seeing the policeman yes i couldnt bear to see that.... just horrible. Maybe  Hollande will give Putin the MISTRALS and there may be no more attacks on France. yeah giving weapons to terrorists usually stops them in the future...LOL",1

"Suspects in #CharlieHebdo attack identified by police as Said Kouachi, Cherif Kouachi &amp; Hamyd Mourad http://t.co/kTtysbF7fX"," sounds swedish... let's be honest  not very breaking!!! can't target all Muslims because of a few nuts LOCS LOCS? Yeah and were fighting in Iraq. Picked up by US troops in Iraq and let go. Went back to France. NBC are reporting 1 dead and 2 captured in Reims, any comment on that story? Breaking ? I knew these names about 3 hours ago RT ""Suspects in CHARLIEHEBDO attack identified by police as Said Kouachi, Cherif Kouachi &amp; Hamyd Mourad Thank you! RT! I've been saying this for years! Oh so it was those Extremist quakers again..... the French ppl should storm the Bastille!! Or police station or whatever agree there find them, bathe them in pigs blood and shoot them with a swine covered bullet no body targeting Muslims, but we should also be honest   with ourselves saying Islam is evil ideology this is so late - hardly breaking news. am certain Berivik was Christian does that make all Christians evil? just saying that's one man. Lately in Paris, Ottawa, quebec etc these have been going on. bbc is a little behind. the human brain is not fully developed until 25. You will find most of these people are under that age do you know the age of today's attackers? Not Yet?Do you? you can say that bcs you never heard what they say in mosques and also because you were not born in Islamic country No. and of courses if u heard u are not going to understand.. Good luck with defending with defunding stg you don't know do you attend a mosque or are you basing your views on media and extremist views?  I live in Ireland were do you live? no I'm basing my views on 25 years living in Islamic country :) by the way age attackers 18, 32 and 34 islamic culture is not going to change. Since the middle ages Europe have plundered the east and this has created tensions we have created this situation and now it has exploded. WW3 will eventually have to happen before it gets resolved. I was born and lived more than 25 years in Arabic Islamic hell, but fortunate now in Europe. Good night good night I didn't say that you should fight them but in Europe and US don't say the truth about islam and they misguide people 18, 32 & amp;34 two of there brains are fully developed. brothers reportedly both early thirties. Their brain knows well what it's doing, both this time &amp; last yes, however before the age of 25 they would have already been radicalised by extremist views. exactly. after 25 the brain will have formed beliefs. They then stay with you must of your adult life. extremist teenagers etc are less likely to question what they are being told by an authority figure. I'd like to share with you info about islam, when people go deep in this religion then they became an atheist or IS member otherwise who don't go deep they don't know a lot and that is what media call moderate Muslims 100,000 out of a billion. .. its the same with all religions. Am a man of science not faith.  Most dangerous thing in the history of the earth!  Religion hell is full of people who claim to be religious I understand what you mean, but when your mother language is Arabic, forced to study islam, born in Islamic country then you would have totally other facts about this so called religion en all those issues I'm not agree its not the same with all religion, islam is very special, anyway I wouldn't call it a religion don't pretend to understand islamic law. Most of the wars are over oil and resources such as agricultural land and water. I agree humans are less than 200,000 years on this planet and we have destroyed what was here millions of years before us.  VIRUS you have to remember most islamic terrorist get their arms from the US! ISIS for one!  Now IS are out of control I wish you a good night, I'm already in bed for long time trying to sleep yes, this is true US and Europe are also using those groups to achieve some of their goals in the Middle East Anyway Good Night good night it differs what you hear in the mosques, many sheikhs are considered extremists Those should be stopped by the gov and replaced. Islam never taught violence. Quran said, if u kill a soul, its like u saved humanity, and if u save one then u saved humanity. It is forbidden for us to even hurt not kill. However this TRUE islamic values are not seen By many people, for i'm sorry and ashamed to say that many muslims nowadays have ruined the name of islam and such terrorists are used by the big boys to divide the world and cause chaos. do you speak Arabic? have you been forced to study islam and Mohamed bloody history ?? I'm a muslim. How about you hear the history of mohamed from a muslim, instead of someone who hates him Who will obviously say nothing good about him. I have asked you if you speak Arabic? it seems not. go learn first Arabic and read the source books :) I do speak Arabic far better than you do. :) anyway i'm not gonna waste my time with you talking about a criminal And thats why he took the certificate of justice from the supreme court? Yea sure. Stay brainwashed buddy. then go read Sirah books and Sahih muslim and Bokhary and enjoy those bloody books. good luck Which part was bloody to you and i can show you how greatly u misunderstood it. I have learned enough about this criminal and have sufferd enough from this criminal ideology. Well what happened to cause you this suffering? which part :D do you know how big are they :D anyway thanks for your offer. i'm not interested As you wish. I hope someday you'll realise that not everyone was bad for christians had the KKK as well.",1
"1st person killed by terrorists was a French Muslim cop, RIP Ahmed Merabet. Bigotry is ALWAYS wrong! #CharlieHebdo http://t.co/yyitubfAIt"," Couldn't have said it better! That tweet is now on my you can push your stupid mantra somewhere else, he did not support Islamo fascism idiot They only use Islam as an excuse no different than McVeigh using Christianity,or RWNJs using Christianity as well. This is the reality In d name heresy etc Christianity used to do persecute murder&amp;violence all sorts in d past 2 be remebd Do not misunderstand me,I despise the terrorists as well! I mean abhor,loathe,despise hate&amp;violence in any name. of course but is history or the present at issue? all religion is delusional, so all types of behavior should be expected Thanks! I'm not a supporter of any religion&amp;perpetrators of any violence Like evolution changes come in stages What?? Are you talking to me?? What mantra did I push? Humans cannot stop being violent any more than they can respect life on this planet Brainwashed pple behave like savages Hindutuva in India is d terrorist outfit to watch The instinct to kill is embedded in human genes as one of d most prominent characteristics in the double Murder in d name of border disputes is not a criminal act is another human hypocrisy Michael, how did you get that from's tweet? ""bigotry is always wrong"" wtf humans are possibly the worst thing to happen to this planet for certain, absolutely not doubt about that Making a game of killing animals is sickening. How can such evil be a form of recreation? I'm not getting it either. I mean I understand what he's saying just don‚Äôt know how my tweet started it. We must believe humans can stop behaving like this. How can the evil of Oligarchy be viewed much differently.We the people need to stand with Berni HUMANS...Mankind is the deadliest creature GOD has put put on EARTH. I'm so confused. Are you saying bigotry isn't wrong? Yeah, I have no idea what's going on, I'm just here for the ride! Lol humans for sure, god, is up for debate, no proof Bigotry meaning what? If God put Humans on Earth then he's a fucking idiot is he calling the executions 'bigotry', b/c if so, its not an appropriate euphemism I despise the terrorists,I also despise the ppl calling for the murder of a billion ppl who happen to look like the killers. I believe in GOD..THE CREATOR who put all living life on planet earth. If you don't belief its ok. are you calling these executions bigotry? Bigotry is a state of mind where a person strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas God was a creation of the human mind as a super cop to control human behaviour not d other way round I dated a guy once who did not believe in GOD..I said its ok..he don't believe in you either. these were actions considered heinous crimes, quite beyond bigotry. When I told my ex bf that GOD did not believe in him ..he was offended? I think he feared GOD bein That's fine, instead of getting angry, explain your position on why you think it was wrong. COOLHEADS Yes !! Maybe he put us here cause other planets were dying..or maybe ... If there was a god violence of all types would not take place earth If there is god IT  is powerless Faith is the premise of all religion because there is no proof. Much less so for specific human ideas of what god is. or maybe GOD is like a scientist creating all kinds of life forms Or we can just acknowledge that majority do NOT act like this! Billions of ppl did NOT kill today! I'm calling it an act of cowards and the perps should be shot and buried in pig shit IN PUBLIC! like earth is a living labatory and we are the experiment &amp; are FAILING. I thought I did on multiple occasions and who's getting angry? why not come out and explain instead of pretend to be offended? I'm in no mood Not angry here, and I saw no other ""multiple occasions"", just the one. :) MAYBE ...MAYBE NOT. I KNOW I BELIEVE IN A CREATOR WHO PUT US ON PLANET EARTH. Bigotry meaning the ppl starting S like kill all Muslims,and Muslim scum, etc. not within the next 50,000 years I'm afraid, evolution doesn't work that fast iT TAKES POWER to make Earth..the SUN and all living creatures ..so I doubt being powerless is GOD Dude, No! My point was the ppl who are saying kill all Muslims are wrong! I pointed out a Muslim was Killed! Our understanding of god is less than a bird's understanding of the moon. Maybe. But humans are definitely a failure whether it was evolution of God There was no euphemism. I seriously have no idea what you are talking about. yes that is TRUE for some humans. Ppl are saying kill all Muslims. I pointed out 1st person killed was Muslim&amp;that bigotry is wrong. How is that a mantra? Or wrong? yes I get that, and said it was inappropriate to push that mantra when the 'audience' knows this and I'm not a he. NO! Not even close. I agree and don't promote these types of people, but this is what 'progressives' are always doing Of course. Are you even reading my replies? trying to temper public opinion  that not all Muslims are bad, duh. there is always HOPE...Pandora's box. GOOD in the end ALWAYS WINS...ALWAYS. Naturally I did not call murders bigotry.Not even close.I was saying you can't hate other 1.6bil because of heinous acts of few I guess we'll find out one day. But I don't hold out much hope for our despicable race I agree. you believe its appropriate to temper public opinion by stating an obvious extreme, how does that show respect? to those murdered by Islamo Fascists? sadly ...yes..humanity is getting more violent bad..evil every year. IF we stay SILENT, MORE people will die. STOPISLAMICTERROR TSARNAEV CHARLIEHEBDO I understand what side you're on, my bad. but I see it this way ..if there is a WAR between good vs EVIL..I pick goodside. Of course The audience does not know. The audience is Twitter&amp;I've seen 1000's of vile tweets to the contrary 1 of my tweets mentioned support of peaceful Muslims,against a 100 against attacks&amp;supporting victims You pick the one? You had to go around many others like this God is imaginary and has long served it's purpose. Yes I know, but forced assimilation policies of Muslims threaten our freedom in general didn't see the others :) Don't worry about the vile tweets. Disregard them. Maybe they're not so vile? yes i don; t doubt it, consider this and what is truly vile in life. OMG! I was supporting one of the people killed!! How is it obvious if so many people are tweeting their hate of ALL Muslims? Existence of god is dependent on brainwashing of young by each religion D day foisting of false info of god into d clean minds is stopped god shall die forever Do you realize MANY of your followers are now trolling me saying I'm supporting terrorists? My husband fought in Iraq,I abhor the sick, twisted killers, aka Islamist extremists! But it's very unlikely to happen as pple who live currently are all brainwashed to believe If there was a god IT must be powerful enough to destroy the evil Forced assimilation? Here? And still, people find the truth. At some point Religion will not exist. a hashtag that says kill all Muslims is vile! Why ISLAM has become home to RADICALISM such as ISIS? Read here: The idea of God might prevail though. Seems like it's part of our DNA Are you seriously trying to convince me Muslim terrorists are bad? Really? Um, no shit! Exactly when did I support them? I agreed with your tweet about justice they should meet It is't part of our DNA it is injected into our brain Fear is one of d reasons for God I tweeted what you are tweeting, that the terrorists killed Muslims. yes and there is a place and time for it, not on heels of their atrocity please Really? If I read the Qu'ran ... ISIS seems to portray the TRUE Islam Fear? Of death? of course what psycho supports that? I should wait until some RWNJ kills a bunch of innocent Muslims? Or Sikhs they misidentify! Or not even RWNJs, I've just learned that MANY on left also can't tell difference between the 2 you can be tad more respectful to today's victims of fanaticism not just idiotic WORDS please The ppl I was referring to in tweet. Many ppl understood that! Twitter was trending hashtags get the difference between actions and words? Where was the last Muslim slaughter in the west? that were horrendous. My husband's bf&amp;battle buddy is Muslim,upsetting to see 1000s calling for his and his family's death! take a look at this article:  highlights what you and ISIS misunderstood sure, yeah when did that happen in the west in this or last century I TWEETED IN SUPPORT OF 1ST VICTIM! HOW IS THAT DISRESPECTFUL TO THE VICTIMS? after Pearl harbor? Incarceration is different that execution So your pro free speech but i can't disagree with those calling for deaths of innocent Americans? I explained. You protect fictional victims while minimizing the atrocity of the real ones, that's how. got it You're anti-violence but I can't call for peace? You're anti-bigotry but I can't call out bigotry? Can you not fight w/someone you ACTUALLY disagree with? We freakin AGREE! Are you talking to me?? Who said anything about Pearl Harbor? Or incarceration? I'm so lost Seriously are you including me on different thread? You are tweeting me things I didn't ever mention? Fictional victims? Yes, America has never killed innocent Muslims. Oh wait...NOWMDS Ok read it. Now sent it to Islamists. I'm good. I don't believe in a creator. So no need for Qu'ran. I said in the west where these terrorists are organizing. And yes they went after oil rather then the Taliban. also think you're forgetting a little thing like the invasion of Kuwait also like a decade of slaughter between Iranians and \Iraqis with MILLIONS KILLED - then they turned on Kuwait its was a war crime Bush committed and Obama supported your making a historical case, I'm giving you examples not on the back of today's victims Um yes, my Husband fought in that war,Bosnia&amp;Iraq 2nd time in 2003-2004 No Pres Obama did not support it,one of a handful that voted against. What??!! Will you please answer if you are speaking to me? I'm not making any points. I literally have no idea who you're speaking to. Who mentioned PH or incarceration? so you know whats been going on, whats the fear America will bomb ISIS positions? I tweeted in support of today's victim!! I do not understand why that's a problem. Did you even see my tweet? RIP to victim? which \Muslims are you afraid will be killed? what is it you are so afraid of, that overshadows today;s killings on the heels of your mantra I'm for that! Fully support that! They need to be eviscerated. good, we agree Do you know a hashtag KILLALLMUSLIMS trended all day? I fear hate crimes. I fear invading wrong country again, etc really? Come on. Besides the fact it's just wrong. I tweeted 1 tweet, very innocuous tweet pointing out victim was a ""good Muslim"" why are you not attacking the 1000s tweeting in support of the terrorists?? Or ones calling for deaths of Billions of ppl? Did you bother to answer the reply I sent in support of bombing ISIS? Or are you just determined to argue w/me for no reason? enough. I'm talking about reality not stupid words that will never transpire obviously. Enough now. Me three. Yes, my mantra is BIGOTRYISALWAYSWRONG sorry you disagree.I'll assume you don't like anti-NA bigotry though?I oppose that 2 I completely agree!No one has ever upset me as much as you on here. We agree but you wanna fight for I don't know what reason To tell you the truth, I despise religion. Its superstitious nonsense. These killers take it to the next level. I try not to hate people who practice religion but it is used to oppress women especially, men and worst of all, children. It makes me angry, like why are they so brainwashed? Religion is a lie, none of them know anything. No god would condone this I don't disagree but I know MANY religious ppl who do not use it to hate(I'm not)&amp;I won't hold them responsible for acts of others Buddists, unitarians, yes there are some. Most of them seem pretty bloodthirsty. I do understand your point and have trouble with it sometimes myself FEAR is not my reason for believing in GOD. I have come close to DEATH ..twice. Due to poor sickness I almost died when I was 4 years old ,then again when I was 25. I just believe in GOD &amp; I do not fear death for it is a part of our lives. I chose to believe in the fact that a creator / A God or Gods put us on EARTH. when you come clothes to death &amp; are in a hospital ...sick,..you do not fear death. There is no harm in you believing in anything that you have been foisted with However(contd you should not impose your believe on others through violence and discrimination Of course dis world has changed a lot over d last 200 yrs but it has to change a lot more Whether you fear death or not it is a certainty &amp; truth If there was no death world (contd) would have been the most monotonous &amp; abominable place in the universe",1
"ID card of Said Kouachi, suspect in #CharlieHebdo attack, found in car left by 2 suspects http://t.co/QBuyFSVORd http://t.co/FyiSZvWJJ5"," Stupid or Deliberate? Well that's not in the slightest bit suspicious is it? they have taken their ID cards whilst they are going to a terrorist act? Clarence Worley seems strange that they had such military precision during the attack but then made this schoolboy error üòï CHARLIEHEBDO why would he leave his ID behind, why? why would he wear a balaclava then leave his ID? He picked the runner of the road! Really? He left his ID? Do you not find that a bit strange? Maybe a finger print or something but his actual ID? that ID card could easily have been planted by the murderers. Hope no one innocent gets hurt. highly suspicious about that personally Ha! what an idiot. US,European MSM present this news event as one of ""troubled,deranged,angry individuals"" not as an act of Islamic Terrorism. like he is that stupid to leave it there..what bullshit!! shame on you blackburn for helping the NEW WORLD ORDER I suspect this is, unfortunately, just the beginning of something even bigger CHARLIEHEBDO Despite french journalists said they were not amateurs... I always opposed ID cards. One reason being criminals are hardly likely to leave them at the scene of a crime - just shows you What a fucking genius!Fucking Murdering Moron Even Better!Hang em From The Eiffel Tower!Upside down! This is very serious, cause I think with this evidence he is on the break of suicide attack! No escape and No hidden place for the duo. They'll be annihilated. Yes, in case of police control on the road! yeah.. sure. guns, masks etc. won't be suspicious enough.. exactly. This appeared to be a well-planned attack. It's like the supposed 9/11 hijacker's passport being found The runner was lost as it was too large. even if it was a plant we have the accomplice to corroborate. Let's not humor any conclusions either way. well, I can smell the bullshit from here... so are you a truther? Jeez. You people are full of it. and you seem a little confused brother. maybe I am, but let's not fuel the fire that all of this is orchestrated to exploit Muslims. I'm not saying that. I'm just saying this photo ID being found seems not to fit with the proposed scenario- or even logic. such military precision that they got the wrong address to start with. reminds me of the passports 'miraculously' found at scene of 911. Looking more false flag by the hour. can anyone say ""false flag""? Who stands to gain from these murders? this is very strange if the video is genuine. Unless you and I are ballistics and weapons specialists, we can't really infer seriously from this. I mean with regards to their tactical demonstration and weaponry skills, they'd been well trained for this mission. nope- and the video may have been tampered with. But IF this is genuine the shot missed. No blood. But the body is in the mortuary there, for people to verify from, i'm sure. Let's be practical. Maybe. We don't know what happened. I'll keep an open mind. But remember it is a publicized event, we needn't set the flame to a clash of civilizations. It isn't. EXACTLY. Some people would like us to think it is. Hence incidents like this. I wonder why..? ;) You're being willfully ignorant of the geopolitical situation in large parts of South Asia and Mid-East. You're wiser than that There are real bad guys. But on the whole people want to get along in peace. That doesn't suit some people's agenda... While you'd like to think so, i invite you to visit India, and Pakistan. Lots of people on either side don't want to get along. I lived in the Middle East and elsewhere. Powerful vested interests manipulate geopolitics-  most people want peace. The Mid-East is a geopolitical quagmire. We can have several long discussions on all this. Tweets seem insufficient. indeed- you can find me here: Not the faintest idea what you are going on about,anyhow have a great evening. I was on about the New World Order. BBC hid and still hide paedos, why do you work for them.You knew jimmy well why no talk.. a job is just a job but what he got away with could have been stopped by so many there and it shows the shame the BBC carry.. forever. Why do you not tell all and shame them? Fame is but fleeting but abuse lasts the whole life of the person abused.... No Answer Tony ???",1
"#ISIS just claimed responsibility for #CharlieHebdo attack and announced more attacks. ""US &amp; UK are on the list for tomorrow."""," source? no source you will need a sourceon that What is the source? Since when did these people start giving warnings? Have they released statement? source? As of yesterday they still talking as it wasn't them. Press agency Belga announces this. is there a source for this? Do you have any source supporting your claim? It's via the Belga new agency. Belga News Agency Belga news agency reports Please provide a link supporting your claim. I can't find anything related. thank you! Belga is not only often wrong but heavily biased &amp; manipulated by state security. Where ?Arabian source? Belga Don't have ISIS sources?I don't know immediately what Belga is based i haven't seen it anywhere. UNVERIFIED. They spoke with Muslims from Mosoel, where it would have been announced during Friday. Hmm, then a statement will undoubtedly follow.Thanks is this the Boubaker al-Hakim connection or actual claim? FRANCE shooting CHARLIEHEBDO It is still waiting for the time being.Things like that are always vague, everyone is reason to preach that. That's why I do not retweet :) I think it is bizarre that Belga would be the first and only one.Doesn't seem to be right. thanks will try to check further Apparently it was said during Friday prayer this morning in Mosul. But all parties have their reasons to say so. I am hearing around ISIS Contacts Let's hear if you know more ... I do too! Right consideration, think IK. None of the IS supporters on Twitter have posted anything. Already a denial inside OK thanks agreed. I think we can agree this is untrue as of now. no confirmation that much going on they didn't claim any responsibility Several ISIS members fall from the sky.I think Belga is not right It is of course possible that 1 is Cleric said this.However, without statement little value.1/2 In that case they go through the bend very briefly. Khutba isn't even published yet I'm just told. Belga statement is false IS likes to show when they commit an attack.Always with flag.In case of Paris, nothing. RT: is happy to show when they commit an attack.Always with flag.In case of Paris, nothing. source?  we don' need no stinkin' source. No official IS statement yet, or is there. Zilch thought I heard on CNN AQAP of Yemen has taken credit. neither i hope they didnot quote belga difference here; warning. No claim they did it Source: DPA : Source: Not the first nor the only .. Source I had already understood thanks to but watch a bit please.This was the only message about this. beats.Only I found the source a bit fragile.That is why it was not wrong, but too early to claim this.No offense. None Taken ..",1
Michael Brown DID NOT STEAL ANYTHING!!!!! It has just been reported that he didn't steal anything #FergusonShooting #Ferguson," Oh, you were there? What station are you watching? but even if he did you don't get to shoot people that steal... Like... NO. Shit is wrong 20 different ways It is not even relevant. Even IF it were, the sentence for shoplifting is not death by execution in the street. FERGUSON ABSOLUTELY!!!! I agree but I was putting that out there for those that felt that his death was justified Several that last bit of info was from fox4 to my memory ... Why did they shoot him? thanks oh I agree that tweet was for the racist troll that used that foolishness as an excuse... Now they have none ""Din do nuffin!"" Just as those ""innocent"" Palestinian terrorists didnt fire rockets my family LIAR You reap what you sow For being black... He was unarmed no reason to pull a gun out Let me explain to you why you're bitch made. You have a lot of mouth but yet no balls to show your face. fuck out my mentions *Blocks* can I ask where this info is from? a fox4 posting ok thank you I will dig into it There is no justification for gunning him down in the street.   TLOT FERGUSON correction kmov 4 those people unfortunately will find a reason to justify the death regardless correction kmov 4 thank you very much. I appreciate it! Stay well!! ok. thanks when does stealing equate to death w/o judge and jury?We let this country get like this and it's been time to take it back. I never said it did. I was letting it be known for racist troll that was using it as an excuse. not saying you did either. I'm just stating the obvious that the militarized police in this country needs to be checked and marching won't do it either. I'm sick of seeing this story on repeat. Ferguson should not allow NAACP or Sharpton in we need to adopt a by any means necessary mindset and protect our community from these domestic terrorists we call police Doesn't even matter if he stole 100 karats. Never warrants MURDER when hands are up, unarmed. I agree that tweet was directed towards the racist trolls trying to use that LIE as a justifiable reason for execution I know that. I was just adding to your disgust. what link? FTP POLICEBRUTALITY Kmov 4 News Here is link: Police Brutality Ferguson Shooting Ferguson Justice for Mike Brown you are an incredibly stupid human being. Tyvem jailkillercops He is INNOCENT until PROVEN GUILTY! He never had the opportunity. Cops ARE NOT the COURT, JURY, JUDGE... Exactly,.now y do u think they started tht rumor!?.So it can seem JUSTIFIABLE!?Now we KNOW it was simply MURDER for NOTHING ""you stupid"" the irony.... Move along BLOCKBUTTONTOOSTRONG She's an ignoramus and can't argue intelligently so she just blocks people. Typical LIBERAL Men ""ON the Rise"" Get used to it...ReadNDAA FERGUSONSHOOTING  FERGUSONRIOT of course he didn't.

The ferguson chief says that his feelings are hurt that ppl consider him a part of the problem. #ferguson http://t.co/VoJGrMOPbZ," What is he SMOKING? He cannot be that stupid. - LOL wow... Making it about his feel feels after a teen has been murdered?! White people love the victim card. They've been making this whole situation all about them by focusing on the looting. He couldn't have been serious... They are so oblivious its damn near hilarious! I don't think looting is effective.  But I'm not going to judge because I don't live there. If that happened in my neighborhood I can't promise that I wouldn't want to tear something up. but that story about a kid attacking a cop for no reason while on his way to his grandmother's house makes so much sense If Red Riding Hood was black, media/cops would've put wolf on paid vacation &amp; talked about his wolf tearz FERGUSON officially my favorite use of this! If the FERGUSON chief thinks his feelings are relevant to his job, that's probably part of the problem. bummer that‚Ä¶So, since when did the cops start having feelings that could be hurt ? ‚ÄúMy officers don‚Äôt go around gratuitously shooting ppl and then bragging about it in seedy paramilitary cop bars‚Ä¶"" ‚ÄúThey go around gratuitously shooting ppl and then agonize about it on social media‚Ä¶and they write poetry‚Äù Art srsly, Douglas Adams called it... That's the pot calling the kettle black! Please don't do the same thing they do, in reverse.  It's ""some"" white people.  :) in the double. It's many.  I don't buy into reverse racism.  It's a farce. If you don't see that young man as a victim than I don't know what one is. Never said he wasn't. I was replying to your racist comment above. It seems to me that many non Black people are focused on the civil disturbances more than the dead kid. I think that's awful and self centered.  They are making it all about them and how they are affected. But that would never happen to their kid so they don't really seem to care.  It's upsetting. The whole situation is awful. The officer should be held accountable for his action. Absolutely!  The looting is unfortunate but I'm not going to judge those people. If I lived there I can't promise that I would react differently. So many people are interested in raking the protesters over the coals instead of looking ... at what caused their reaction. Thanks for listening. We should never as people respond to a crime with crime. We should do what's right. Even though it seems difficult. This country doesn't need racial division. We are Americans. I agree.  I hope the Ferguson PD comes to the same conclusion It's too many, that's for sure. BTW - you said ""white people love the victim card"" and I felt judged because of my skin color. boo fucking hoo join the club. Advocate that same thing for PoC and stop thinking of yourself You should recognize a friend when you see one. I believe the solution is thinking of everyone. Well I don't. And you've done anything but prove yourself as a ""friend"" whatever that means. u r tweeting w/white ppl right now who r on ur side yet u condemned us all. C problem? Your anger is understandable.  But your generalized judgement is a shame. Yes. Because you feel that having white people on our side should be such a blessing. We should be so thankful for it. The comment was a generalization but that generalization no need to be condescending. So by your comment its us against them? I agree with always a blessing when people stand together for what's right. exactly. So don't lose the purpose of the tweet by RahRahing for white people over a genrlztn RahRahing for white people? advocating against meaningless and harmless white prejudice. I didn't advocate for white people. So you're saying every white person is racist. I Clearly Said Prejudice. I don't know you personally.  I judge people as individuals. But if I had to make a generalization about WP it would be that most of them harbor some racism. Based on my personal experiences, 39 years of observations, history and current events ... most people would objectively come to the same conclusion. Me blowing smoke up your behind would not do anyone any good. Sad.  Nonetheless, I'll stand for your rights. Stand for the Constitution and the American Dream.  That's what's being violated. I do.And more. that time Mike Brown has no feelings to speak of.",1
"Maybe hard hitting @foxnews should be covering what's going on in #Ferguson, Mo. instead of fat shaming the First Lady??"," the certainly would be FAIRANDBALANCED Please dont use news. In the same sentence.  As Fox.  It's FOX SPEWS. That might actually be news, not punditry. The local Fox ""News"" affiliate was told they couldn't fly their chopper in FERGUSON - no fly zone over the town. But then that would be reporting facts--something that never works in the favor of gathering their hateful viewers. This is we're talking about! Insulting liberals is their first priority. Maybe should just remove the word 'news' before they are pulled up on trades descriptions. oh i think the world can do without's opinion of FURGUSON....... call it like you see it. Awesome! it's like the real news outlets only cover what social cares about smfh WADR, what have you thought of how they HAVE covered it up to this point? 24 hr news cycle is not optimal for that I'm not glad it happened here but the local coverage has been very good. The journalists have been on the streets nightly. because she's so fat? buttt..they have. Ablow is an ahole but you fail to get the grasp of what the ladies were saying about govt lunches. and calling Robin Williams a coward. all they will cover is the looting My dear that so called news network is incapable of seeing the forest for the trees.

"Question for #Ferguson police chief? If OFFICER DARREN WILSON was in pursuit of a robbery suspect, why tell kids to get out of the road? LIE"," This is my fucking Question !!! I could not agree more, it just plain sounds preposterous. And why did he NOT get OUT of the car. It has to be a huge LIE. are they calling Mike Brown a suspect? If so, why didn't he stop them and check them? I'm all types of confused. shits not adding up. What convenient store was robbed? Who are the witnesses that called it in? that's what they took 4 days to concort ?...those 2 situations don't seem related at all More like why was DARRENWILSON trying to pull MIKEBROWN into police car thru the window? - Barney Fife would have tried to pull MIKEBROWN through a window too. Shades of Ernest T. Bass FERGUSON A good question. I still think the cop was on drugs and hallucinating. Agreed, Dante! Agreed-also,if MIKEBROWN was suspect,why not just question him? Why tell him &amp; friend get off road,not stop them? BSDETECTOR And at least Barney Fife would have been HONEST from the first hour. - The Barney Fife fear is real in FERGUSON, total excessive force is common practice. This was a murder! Agree those Cops in FERGUSON are filled with FEAR so they hide behind military equipment, outrageous tactics Thank goodness the cops in FERGUSON aren't very bright. Makes it easier to sue their sorry asses! and his bullet would have been harmlessly in his pocket. FERGUSON They had 2 splice some tapes together. The cops can't spin this unlawful shooting try as they may. Police Dept. credibility ruined with Ferguson community. how convenient for this police chief....he needs to just go - Spin still doesn't justify the murder versus the arrest. Why did the FERGUSON officer not call for backup? Another question, how would the police engage a suspect from INSIDE his vehicle? And, why not question 2nd suspect? Racist LIE to make it seem like innocent black child was a criminal. It will not work!! Police LIE may start more riots IF Brown committed strong arm robbery is one thing,but cop response is still another entirely. No riots. Justice - Even if not innocent, no justification for violating rights, removing due process &amp; execution FERGUSON MURDER! It's a LIE. Police originally said confrontation started b/c cop told Michael to get out of street &amp; walk on sidewalk. Absolutely My Point !! There's no spin, cops blew it from day one by not releasing shooter's name! Trying to control the narrative w/liesüëéüö´. There are pics of ""strong arm robbery"" clothing description/size of assailant similar BUT cop deadly force? No! You're right! Police said fight started after cop told Michael to get out of street, walk on sidewalk! He was never a suspect! Alasscan it's a lie. Pics are fake. No robbery was reported! If true, police would have said it last week to stop riots - FERGUSON PD tried to justify probable cause, even 1st &amp; 2d shot, everything after = premeditated murder. He is innocent of any death penalty offense. Even if assault is involved. The problem is that some police and others believe in a concept of a Free Kill. - Even if robbery took place &amp; stop legal, actions after 1st &amp; 2d shot &amp; after MIKEBROWN put HANDSUP = MURDER Absolutely! Sadly DORIANJOHNSON friend of MICHAELBROWN was in store also &amp; has admitted to it IMO no shot should've happened. Call was unarmed suspect, cop had full description, easy to find where he lived Where there is just enough justification that a person thinks they can get by with it. Besides a person who committed a robbery wouldn't call attention to himself by walking in the middle of the street. It's a lie. - FERGUSON cop administered ""Street Justice."" Execution for alleged robbery, No go! Sov. Citizen in Dallas this week PLANNED TO KILL COPS and was brought in alive, how come a Shoplifter is denied same courtesy? It doesn't matter if you are police, gang, or neighborhood watch. Life means more. Never mentioned ""robbery"" in his confrontation with them...where is the corresponding dispatch call? Probable cause for what? The alleged robbery that cop wasn't aware of (so it appears) or alleged assault of cop? - FERGUSON PD new story is trying to establish: probable cause, justify 1st &amp; 2d shot, but can't justify extras. theve acted the same even over a bag of chips Why did it take 5 days for this ""info"" to come out? Looks like FERGUSON PD is looking for excuses for murder. Corey, think we're gonna find out DWilson had no idea that MB had stolen Swishers. WAIT4 IT. -FERGUSON PD trying to make case for probable cause, initial 1st &amp; 2d shot, but can't for execution w/Hands Up Of course not...they have this fake police report, but no dispatch call detailing alleged robbery! : Cop never mentions shooting. Dispatch never mentions robbery. get outta d f'in road! (moreover). I'm sorry, time to call for the arrest now, of Mr. Darren Wilson. But they have had six days to come up with a narrative though! time to arrest D Wilson, guys.  Sorry, but shooting ppl u think are thieves isn't OK. - Isn't this STLPD Dispatch, and not FERGUSON? FERGUSON created smokescreen knew it was murder! - No narrative will justify actions after the 2d shot, MIKEBROWN surrendered, cop kept firing Robbers do not just stroll down the middle of the street after robbing a store. IDIOTS FERGUSON and that's cold blooded murder! There is a very fishy fishing expedition going on in FERGUSON looking for excuses for murder. Someone needs to explain how the cop shot MICHAELBROWN &amp; then NEVER called an ambulance? The let him die so he could not talk. Police station learned of shooting from the news not Wilson - Wilson knew he intentionally killed an alleged suspect trying to surrender to him &amp; people saw it. I know : (  but sicker part is we don't know if Michael was dead or the let him die so he couldn't talk Michael never received emergency medical treatment, they left him in the street &amp; labeled the event a riot not a robbery suspect apprehended. Bingo. | We need to see/review the statement by officer Wilson on what happened. It's not about smarts, it's that they never had to justify their actions  ""Rubber Stamped"" TYPICAL OF COWARDS AND BULLIES Yes !! To think after all this time a lame-assed story about stolen cigars is going to fly is beyond stupid! Affluent people and those in authority take it as an affront to be questioned, especially by lesser people Apparently they don't think people can think for themselves. How WRONG they are. Will live to regret it Yes! AND that attitude will be their downfall too. Bet on it. That makes no sense at all. Police LIED 'Ferguson police chief: Officer didn't stop Brown as robbery suspect' Chief admits 'friend' did NOT confess to a crime! Cop did not stop Michael as a suspect!  LIES! You were correct yesterday! Ferguson police chief: Officer didn't stop Brown as robbery suspect Fri: Police LIED saying ""friend' confessed to robbery. NOW Chief says, he did NOT commit crime All a damn LIE. Plant the image of a violent black man &amp; say he was a suspect. DID NOT WORK! Police lied! Chief now says Michaels's friend was NOT involved in any robbery. Dorian's lawyer said in CNN interview Dorian had admitted it as he give his witness statement Dorian admitted from day 1.Now rumor has it that store never called 911 who called? 911 tape? Heard that friend was not going to be ""charged"" in any robbery since video shows it was other person Makes me wonder since robbery report filled out day later. Also was cigarillo value raised? Who is 'other person?' 1st police LIE saying friend confessed. Under pressure, they now say he was not involved 1st interview POLITICSNATION DORIANJOHNSON mentions cigarillos &amp; told lawyer. Video shows he gave back, not Mike FERGUSON I say no more STREETJUSTICE/freekill. No matter who does it. Max are you listening to what the Chief of Police said or do you just want to believe lies? Listen carefully Don't understand your argument - we're both on same side. Was repeating what Dorian said. Also Chief walked stmt back later Now another store video out that some say shows MICHAELBROWN DID pay 4 cigarillos - confusing This shows Michael paid for cigarillos. No robbery, no crime! Pls RT Thing is Killer cop knew nothing -was just being a ASSHOLE BULLY-started to leave backed up-killed kid",1
"REMINDER: #MikeBrown was a kid who just wanted to walk down a street. And for that, HE IS DEAD. Those are the facts. #Ferguson"," RT: REMINDER: MIKEBROWN was a kid who just wanted to walk down a street. And for that, HE IS DEAD. Those are the facts. FERGUSON Reminder,  he is a suspect in a crime and allegedly assaulted a police officer. Maybe some facts...but you're not telling all of the facts...only some of the story. You were there? You saw with your own eyes?  I prefer to wait for full truth. If chief is lying, then he should be fired. he committed a robbery then punched a cop in the face, those are facts no they are not. yes, they are. The photos of him match the police report Can you say ""Trayvon Martin?"" seriously how many names could we say? wao many the chief has now told two contradictory stories. By definition, he is lying in at least one of them. He could be, or he could have been given bad info before. But given Ferguson history, it doesn't look good for chief. Jose Guerena case shows cops may lie to deflect blame. Guerena's family won lawsuit, but Tucson sheriff won reelection anyway. if he's ""been given bad info before"" and publicly states that bad info, that is called ""lying"" Not if he doesn't know it's bad info at the time. If somebody tells you something that's not true, and you repeat it (because you thought it was truth), does that make you liar? depends on the obligation one would expect you to do due diligence before passing on lies, no? It's called delegation. Person in charge expects underlings to do gruntwork of due diligence. - unpopular opinion incoming. Would this have been as big, if the police officer was dead instead? I'm not asserting police chief IS telling truth. I'm saying he COULD have thought story was truth at time. What is your point? - because making an emotive tweet on a tragic death isn't the best presentation of it. I doubt it'd have been done for the officer. An unarmed kid was shot dead in the street, his body left for hours, and the police keep changing the story. EXCUSE MY EMOTING. why the fuck does it matter what would be done if it had been the officer? IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN; THE KID WAS UNARMED. you wanting to change the story to make this about the not-dead or not-even-injured or not-arrested cop is ridiculous derailing. also it's not an opinion. - sorry for that impression, I don't want to make it about the officer. I want objective views, not emotive tangents. Nothing more. idea that anything can be ""objective"" is false. And the idea that ""emotion"" somehow means ""not trustworthy"" = WHATEVER Not sure why you think anybody gives a fuck what you ""want"". - Twitter's crap at letting me get it all out decently. Basically, reminding people someone's dead is pointless. Everyone knows (1/2) - you're in a position of authority, and you're using that to leverage this view. Just my opinion, I'm not the only one to reply. - nor you. Personal attacks aren't the best way to conduct yourself, yo. it's not pointless. And fuck yeah, I am leveraging my opinion. It's my Twitter account. I should apologize for this? - not at all, sorry again. I'm offering my opinion like you were offering yours. That's all. I didn't even expect a reply! surprise! This. we are made up of emotion. Objective is often a code for male/real/white. - we are indeed, but ya need to consider things without emotion sometimes. Judges don't rule on emotion! hahahahahahahaada epo ok, player I think you really need to study ""objectivity"" and question that concept. his profile states 100% dolt. we have our answer. - sure thing. I'm young, I've got plenty to learn. - in joke, community-related. It's funny how quick people jump to insults though :/ Yo, go fuck yourself, yo. waaaa waaaaaa poor widdle white dude feefees. yawn. don't make it about emotion! suck it up! yeah, definitely no ""emotion"" in the way the criminal justice system pursues alleged cop killers either. - I'm not. It's funny. Having to resort to personal attacks in order to bait some kinda rise. - definitely a huge problem. The biggest problem here though is a lack of transparency all round. - not that I ever stated what my feelings on the FERGUSON situation was. Death is awful. yes, yes bc you are clearly the smartest, best and more deserving of humanity. yes, we know white man, it is about YOU here. - more about me than you, given the attention I'm getting. Peace out. If you really think that you need to go back to school. Everyone absolutely does, unless they are sociopathic. - if a judge ever sent someone to prison because the judge didn't like the defendant, then that's unlawful. - deciding without emotions on occasion != devoid of emotions (sociopathy). don't know what your point is. People are emotional when someone's shot. If it's a cop, cops are emotional. - original point was lost somewhat, no worries. People are emotional, never disputed that. when it's a kid, people who empathize with kids are emotional. There is no emotion-free perspective. - when observing the situation, then you have to have more of a clear head.",1
today #MichaelBrown would've completed his 1st week of college &amp; #Ferguson police chief spent most time suggesting he's the criminal," Not that he was--but even criminals should not be shot when they have surrendered and put hands up. Where did police suggest that? What a fucking cunt. he was a criminal.  Stop over looking the facts... fact: unarmed teen FERGUSON fact: reached for officers gun and wrestled him inside his car... From the mouth of the witness SORRYIMNOTSORRY only police have said that-3 eyewitnesses have not. POLICE have confirmed he was unarmed-that's 1 constant fact FERGUSON the ""facts"" have been coming out in such a haphazard way-hard for any to be consistent-autopsy will really help FERGUSON I don't agree with alot that had happened.  And I feel the office should answer for alot,  but don't paint a pic that brown was completely innocent. there's a LOT left to learn-this has been a terribly handled situation with a community in pain-hope more facts are shared I do agree with you there.  Handled terribly,  and hard to know what to believe.  Just want peace I don't understand ""whooping on Clarks"" &amp; ""what don't you see"" luckily you are alive &amp; free to receive more education Question is: why is this even being labeled a ""robbery?"" No weapons were involved. Shoplifting, maybe, but robbery?? There are no facts that say he was a criminal. There aren't even facts that there was a ""robbery."" It's a robbery the second you touch an employee. W/out weapons it's strong arm robbery. picture on top shows the robbery.  Called a strong arm robbery,  and it's a felony Strong-armed robbery involves a WEAPON. No weapon shown here. Oh so now we're making up terms to suit murdering an 18-year old for shoplifting. Of course conveniently PD deletes the part of the video that shows he PAID FOR THEM... He paid for them. Why delete that part of the video??? If he paid for him, why would his friend admit they stole them? LOL. I often admit to crimes I never committed. It's easier for U to believe a lie than the truth/video. The store didn't report a robbery. No weapons. Johnson admitted it. Brown violently shoved the clerk. End of story. are you so desperate for him to have been an angel? He wasn't. He was an asshole. It's sort of beside the point though. You knew him personally? Oh, right. You just built all of this up in your mind. He paid for the cigars. End of story. You're one dumb bitch.lol You're an idiot and a racist! LOL Racist = The word idiots use when they lose an argument. Actually it's a word used when dealing with a racist. Name calling is a tactic used by GOP right-wingers who have NOFACTSJUSTPERSONALATTACKS Fact: Dorian Johnson admitted to robbing store. (that's an ACTUAL fact). not a fact: I'm a right winger because I believe in due process. You seem to think that anyone who doesn't agree with you... is a racist republican. That's called a stereotype, which is actually much closer to racism. Let me give you another fact. fact: I'm an independent who has never voted republican. I'm a minority who doesn't have rights you likely take for granted I'm an ex-Republicann now Independent, who doesn't like tea party nut jobs and I take my rights extremely seriously. Fact: the surveillance video shows him paying for the cigars. Fact: store never called in a robbery I've never been a Republican, never voted for a Republican, and have ALWAYS been an independent. As a gay man, I also take my rights very seriously. I watched the surveillance video--including the 'new one' where people say he paid. I don't see him paying. I also saw him push that clerk and walk him down. Terrible behavior. Seems like an asshole. BUT-being an asshole doesn't get a bullet. However, we don't actually KNOW what happened yet between Wilson and Brown. Hopefully investigation will get answers. Store didn't report a robbery. Didn't know why police wanted surveillance footage. Clerk pushed him first. Does that make him an a*shole? we know a cop shot an unarmed 18 year old at least six times. The clerk was not pushing him for fun. He was obviously doing something he wasn't supposed to... You're getting too much of your info from DailyKos. lol So? That doesn't mean it wasn't justified. Cops shoot unarmed people all the time if they are threatened. It's justifiable. my point is if someone pushes you, expect to be pushed back I had a co-worker whose son was shot because he was committing an unarmed robbery. Justifiable. (And the shooter was civilian.) doesn't make either one an a*shole After somebody walks out of a store with your shit? C'mon. I've never pushed a clerk. Stop reading Dailykos. Not a reliable source. Stick to major news outlets (and take with grain of salt). A wise man once said: ""Believe your eyes, not the lies."" I don't see Brown paying for anything. I see an altercation between a clerk and a customer. The customer has unbagged items in his hands and the clerk is pursuing. Brown shoves the clerk then walks him down. That's what I see. Sorry. meanwhile James Eagan Holmes shoots 82 people in Aurora and is taken alive... If there was a robbery, the store would have reported it. thats what I know. Sorry. Please. This is what happens when you believe your own eyes... Erm...Okay? (Unrelated...) Okay, so where in the video is he paying? Do we know why the clerk bothered pursuing him? Why pursue if he paid? Let's pretend I DO see him paying--which I don't... Then there's this! (lol) actually it's very pertinent. try this one. It gets to the point quicker... Using this as evidence for the Brown case is a logical fallacy called 'faulty generalization.' No robbery. No weapons. Sorry. I don't believe an unarmed 18 year old should be shot for shoplifting either. ROTFLMAO. Yeah right. Easy to say when the generalizations aren't being made about you. Lets be real, if Justin Beiber was shot for shoplifting cigars from a convenience store we'd be taking about excess force.' Justin or Wynonna ... It's robbery if you touch a person in the store. Err... First of all... It's an actual LOGICAL FALLACY (it's a philosophical term). Second of all, it's a fallacy that... Discredits Generalizations. since when? Since Michael Brown was shot? Strong-armed robbery is robbery using a weapon. There's no such animal as a ""Strong-arm"" robbery. Let's be real... It has a lot to do with the threat a person poses. Bieber = minimal threat. Guy who is angry and 6'4""... Um. Yes there is. It's a legal term. Robbery is theft using threat of DEADLY Force. No--it's not. You're obviously not a lawyer. This isn't remotely what happened in this situation. LOL. Now that's funny! Theft is the ABSENCE of force. Robbery is any application of force, even a nudge can bump it from theft to robbery. Yes, it it. For it to be robbery, there must be fear of deadly harm. This is pointless. Just look it up. I'm through here. Oh, please! QUOTE FROM WEBSITE: Robbery is a violent crime, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the victim has to suffer any type of injury It‚Äôs enough to commit a robbery if you use any type of force to take property from someone I hope you're an adjunct, because if not, you're a fucktarded law professor. The operative word here is violent. I never said a word about an injury. I said FEAR. NOWHERE IN ANY LAW BOOK does it say robbery involves the threat or application of DEADLY FORCE. Go ahead, prove me wrong. LOL!!! Whatever... So you're arguing that the legal definition of robbery vs. theft is contingent upon the victim's ""feelings"" LOL FEAR. That's F-E-A-R. You said the threat of DEADLY FORCE is required. It's absolutely NOT. Um, the victim doesn't have to FEAR FOR HIS/HER LIFE for it to be a robbery, you jerk. LOL. You're ridiculous. Absolutely. Fear of violence doesn't mean being pushed. Give me a break. In fact, the person doesn't have to FEEL anything. It's robbery if force or the THREAT OF FORCE is used. It's an act of violence. So, yes, that's included under FORCE. If I walk into a store and say give me all of your money or I'll push you‚Ä¶.that's a robbery???? PUH-leaze. Actually, even if he HADN'T pushed him, if he took something then WALKED HIM DOWN, that's still robbery. Research is fun. Great. See you in court. It's a threat of violence AND you're taking something in the person's control. Yes, that's robbery. Well, it's robbery once something is taken. If you walk into a store, shove the clerk, and take a candy bar. It's robbery. If you take the candy bar and sneak out, theft. I'd hope so, you're a hot mess. Hey, we define violence differently. And of course, depending on who's doing what, we'll label it differently. (I'm not defining it. I'm letting the LAW define it. That's why I'm giving sources...) You know, like the boys sleeping in the car in the video I posted were plotting a robbery, according to 9-1-1 calls. Ah, but he didn't walk into the store and shove the clerk. Two issues: Stereotyping shouldn't ever occur. Stereotypes are not always baseless. (The second one makes me racist, right?) He didn't walk into the store and threaten the clerk either. Let me give you an example. Many people think all gay men are lisping, mincing fairies. I'm not. However--it's not baseless... many gay men are lisping, mincing fairies. If you're a police officer--you're not supposed to use racial profiling (or security at an airport)... However, there is reason He walked up to the register. There doesn't seem to be any altercation at the counter. to profile. Who's more likely to blow up a plane? A middle aged man of middle eastern decent--or a 95 year old white woman? You're making suppositions. Fact is, it's unclear. Johnson doesn't dispute a crime happened. All sources reporting (like dailykos) are trash. It looks like a strong arm robbery to me. You disagree. We should move on from this. except for the 9-1-1 bombers had European passports, dyed hair and didn't look middle eastern. Unless they completely changed their faces, they looked middle eastern. lol. LOL. Suppositions? You mean like the ones you're making? You're right. These are suppositions! &amp; they shouldn't matter. The policeman didn't know anything about the convenience store What I'm getting to is this. 1/11 black men are in prison. 1/45 white men are in prison. 11-12% of Americans are black. They We see the same things and yet see different things. That's human nature and that's the problem here. make up 40% of the prison population. It's not COMPLETELY absurd that cops would use these statistics and profile. No, it's not RIGHT. It's stereotyping--but it makes logical sense. Sad but true. That is why there is such unrest in Ferguson right now. Because I never know when what you're seeing isn't what I'm seeing. There's unrest because the popular narrative is that a white police officer gunned down a young black man for no reason. MOST crime is committed by whites. Blacks go to jail more often than whites for the same offenses. (And for a smaller percentage of protesters there's unrest because, hey, who doesn't love flat screens?) Doesn't mean that's what happened. We don't KNOW what happened. True. Whites are the majority of the population. Indeed. Blacks go to jail more often. Also true. That could account for some of the discrepancy. However, even if it counted as HALF of the discrepancy, that would still mean a black man is twice as likely to commit a crime as a white man. Much of it has to do with economics. Economically, black men tend to be more likely to live in poverty. Ummm. Gunned down an unarmed man. The reason matters little. Regardless of the reasons, though--black men are still statistically much more likely to commit crime. Hence profiling. Sorry. Faulty math there. Sad? YES. Unfair? ABSOLUTELY. Logical? Well..yeah. No, it's not. If 1/11 black men are incarcerated vs. 1/45 white men, that means that 10% of black men are imprisoned. 2% white. I discounted HALF of those crimes for reasons you mentioned: 5% black men vs. 2% white men. That only proves what I said earlier, that black men are arrested and convicted for situations white men get away with. So, in a way you're right. An individual black man, statistically would be MORE THAN TWICE as likely, discounting 1/2 of crimes You can't supposed from that any greater propensity for crime. Sorry. Actually... You absolutely can. Mathematically it's true. I don't think melanin has anything to do with it though. I argue that economics and a culture that glamorizes crime have to do with it. Nope. Not true. Sorry. Also, the war on drugs increased all incarcerations significantly. You don't like math? Statistically, since there are more white people and they commit the majority of crime... you are more likely to stumble across a criminal by targeting white men. Yes, we're talking PERCENTAGES though. If you're talking about profiling, you're talking about likelihood, that mean's PERCENTAGES. No, you're not. If you took 100 white men and 100 black men, statistics show only TWO white men would be criminals. (10 black) Yes, there are MORE white people. But that is irrelevant to the point I'm making. Are there MORE white criminals? YES! There are WAY MORE WHITES. Are they more LIKELY to be criminals. NO. Not by a longshot. It's about PERCENTAGES (profiling is ALL about percentages) You can twist percentages around to mean a lot of things. Blacks make up nearly 1 million of the 2.3 million prison pop. in the US. That's 6x more than whites. Statistically, it has been predicted that 1/3 black men will spend time in prison during their lifetimes. (Most for non violent drug offenses.) I am an advocate for short term sentences for non violent offenders and legalizing marijuana. I dislike profiling immensely. However, I understand why it is used. No, this is pretty cut and dry. It's not statistics from disputed studies of small populations. This is from census data. Every man and woman should be judged as an INDIVIDUAL. Every man and woman has the right to due process--regardless of race. This includes ALL black men...and yes, Darren Wilson too. Being a policeman is not an easy job and they're easy to demonize. How about we wait to demonize this one until the facts are in? If he's guilty--demonize away. Not for legalizing marijuana at all. sorry. Not demonizing. However, paid leave is hard to stomach. And there's a history of problems in Ferguson that go beyond one incident. I've never tried marijuana--but I know from personal (family) experience, that it doesn't ruin life quite like booze. Alters brain chemistry, mood altering, kills memory, brain cells.. Of course it's mood altering. That's the point. Brain cells are not killed. At worst it increases the speed at which the brain deteriorates with age. The most respected studies show that THC does NOT kill brain cells with daily or even heavy use. It's actually healthier than cigarettes (which are physically addictive, THC is not), and it does less damage than booze. Psychiatric effects of cannabis | Psychology Today: Marijuana addiction is real | Marijuana, Brain Disorders and Schizophrenia | All of the experts agree it causes the amotivational syndrome and decreases memory... 10 Reasons to stay away from weed. 8. Lower IQ. 10. Personality changes American Medical Journal: Pros and cons in one post | I'm in my thirties. How would it impair my development? I'm not suggesting kids use it regularly. Adults should have access. 10. People are nicer on weed. Fact. It's ironic you'd cite one very biased source to show ALL EXPERTS AGREE (they don't). It's as real as any mental addiction. It's not physically addictive. Nobody is arguing that marijuana doesn't have some negative effects. It's still better than booze, which is legal. Honestly, the negative effects are minimal and manageable if used with caution and care. Again, I disagree. Nope. Not a fact. Weed causes permanent personality changes and can cause irritably and aggressiveness. Sorry you need to tell this to someone who hasn't seen the opposite first hand. I've known plenty of potheads that function just fine and are active, intelligent people. THC is like anything else--if you abuse it, it's going to have negative effects. Same with booze, cigs, fatty foods, etc. thats like saying i know plenty of alcoholics that function just fine.. everyone knows that white men tend to get killed by white men and black men by black men. Not new. Great. This entire exchange started over my comment about using black-on-black crime as a subterfuge. what are you talking about? you really aren't very good with deciphering our giving meaning to statistics ask yourself why black on black crime might be a focus of media attention and white on white crime isn't. the answers are all there in the statistics. All you need to do is think about them. of interracial crime, blacks commit 85%. Many times more likely to commit homicide. Black on black violence is a problem... disproportionately, black men commit violent crimes. It's a problem that needs a solution. Hence the media focus. read up stop the lies... the way to fix this is to stop stripping the wealth from black communities disproportionately property values are devalued in black communities, disproportionately black incomes are predominately less this is nonsense. this is why my children need protection from twisted thinking like yours. Regardless of the reasons, there are more black criminals. It's not exactly a lie. I mentioned economic factors. You wonder why property values are lower in black neighborhoods? See earlier statistics. You can blame the gov't, the economy, schools, whatever. In the end, you have to acknowledge that violence is a PROBLEM in... black communities. Nobody is going to ride in and save them. They need to save themselves. The best way is to change the... cultural values in these communities, reduce drug use and gang influence, and encourage higher education. You didn't find this funny? (The source I meant to post.) You post one european-centric white supremacist website and EVERYBODY thinks you're a racist. JOKEZ YOu watch way too many movies. Don't believe every music video you see. Sorry. Devaluation came before crime. Sorry. I know better than this. THe lies don't work with me. This is the lie perpetuated by the right.",1
"The info given today seems to line up with this witness account, even the alleged theft: http://t.co/7hjBIrf1a3

#Ferguson #MikeBrown"," how did MICHAELBROWN get way across town on foot in 2mins the timeline don't add up smh and his body wasn't place in an ambulance still trying to reach you for Nat'l Cdn interview, can u pls DM or contact me: 1 416 205 6389 or kim.taylor-galway.ca TY is the friend in the video in the photos the police have? Doesnt show him robbing. Shows him in the store. Poss Cover-up. Cops had a week. Had hands in air, stopped. Still Murder Seems like the two incidents are independent of each other and not connected as might be concluded. Profanity Warning MT The info given today seems to line up with this account, even the alleged theft: We will see it does look like Him kinda piecing together an excuse for executing a teenager, it's disgusting. All involved need investigating. doesn't excuse his murder, though. I don't accept anything presented as a reason Mike Brown is dead. Saw this a few days ago. Glad you tweeted it. Justice for Mike Brown: Ferguson Mike Brown Yes it does. But regardless of whether a SHOPLIFTING CRIME occurred, murder is not the proper response by FERGUSONPD SHAME He did a good job of refuting that possibility in his account, too. He explained very clearly how that wasn't even possible. smear tactic I agree, there are serial killers who are still alive and well sitting in jail, killing someone for theft makes no sense it's no time stamp so the FERGUSON police had 5day to makeup watever &amp; get a black man to play that part in some store Are you saying Johnson admits to the theft in the video? Because I watched it and didn't get that. Or am I misunderstanding? funny how days later they ""found"" a black man wit almost the same outfit come on it's bullsh*t We have seen this week that Police can't be trusted.  And the narrative is always that the dead Black kid had it coming.  Angry! we will see man. I'm not jumping to any conclusion. I'll admit it does fit his description but you cold be right that logo on his hat and shoes will tell all. And the store victim *COULD too many lies by FERGUSON police Ferguson mikebrown all i got to say that video which I seen a few days ago is  irrevlant. He wasn't there when the store was rob no. He was there when the cop hym this video proves nothing. We will see wants the store video and victim of store speaks ur rite I need those ppl from the store to come forward, the photo of the cop who claims he got beat by MIKEBROWN, MIKEBROWN finger print of the officer gun which is hard to take out a holder he says if was not quik trip. And i hear ferguson market says he paid. ok...üôè all the truth actually comes out. rellos 2 for 99cent. That's robbery? Even 6 packs don't run u 10. RT: rellos 2 for 99cent. That's robbery? Even 6 packs don't run u 10. once you push an employee it's strong-arm robbery. look at the times on the frames. 52 to 53. And somebody said ferguson said he paid, so was there another altercation? shoplifting and assault. Strong arm would be pushing the employee to obtain the items, no? value of the property not a factor. Robbery is a taking by use of force/fear. Still, didn't look like Mike on that tape I agree. Doesn't match up...I'm just telling you why he's accused of robbery not shoplifting Nope. precisely but robbery over shoplifting enhances the perception. And strong arm would be forcefully taking. He was on his way out I'm almost positive if I push u on my way out it doesn't turn into strong arm robbery. U may want to look that up. news says suspect pushed employee when asked to pay for cigarillos. just incredible that we are still dealing with young black men dying at the hands of those who should protect. regardless even if MIKEBROWN DID something(as alleged) the price 4 any scuffle shouldn't be being MURDERED by FERGUSON cops THANK YOU!!! I just call them the way I see them. Justice for Mike Brown Yea I'm really confused on that part of the video as well... I remember watching this video on Monday. Yeah, I still don't hear that kid saying they stole them. also lines up pretty well with the witness MSNBC spoke with last night. Dorian says the cashier didn't call police. Is there a tape of the 911 call? Autopsy results will help corrobor refute. Dorian says he was hit by car door, shot in head at close range, shot after dead. MIKEBROWN as suspect should've been made public MUCH earlier-Todays PD report=legal tactic as I said This was the first eyewitness account I'd seen, and this man still hasn't been interviewed. Please interpret that for us white people. Sub titles maybe. from what I understand from the video. He agrees with the police report. Sorry that is the best I can do. Thanks. This is devastating.  But, he still didn't deserve to die.  FERGUSON MIKEBROWN JUSTICEFORMIKEBROWN *Adult language MT info given today seems to line up w/ this witness account, even alleged theft:  ‚Ä¶ it was him that shopped lift still don't justifiable to shoot a man several times!! Agree horrible JUSTICEFORMIKEBROWN",1
Update: #Ferguson police release stills from convenience store footage showing robbery http://t.co/rl0RgIphUp http://t.co/PHUofG7mJR," Gentle giant. is that Mike Brown? the guy in these pics looks a lot bigger than the pics of Mike Brown in prior still photos released? oh well that just justifies everything doesn't it.  HANDSUPDONTSHOOT That person does not look 18. It actually looks a lot like a looter with their face  covered that was photographed by check your facts and the pics from what he was wearing when he was gunned down, smh Good folk of Ferguson, Support your Police Dept., Riot against the THUGS in your town. This proves what? RT Update: FERGUSON police release stills from convenience store footage showing robbery Gentle Giant, RIGHT. Go arrest that partner he had too. JUSTICE FOR THE POLICE DEPT. they were doing their job &amp; protecting your sorry butts. Waiting to see an outpouring of sympathy for the owner of the store that was attacked.  Not holding my breath. doesn't excuse murder that dude is huge are you really justifying the murder of an unarmed kid? o red hat? He wasn't a kid, an Adult who was robbing a business. if the officer did his job he would be arrested not murdered. Still the point. are you justifying the murder of an unarmed ADULT? here goes the fukkry now look at his picture.o wait he is black robber black. Has it been confirmed. Or just blow smoke our bum YES, it was JUSTIFIED umm wasn't Mike Brown wearing pants, and shoes? you are saying that's mike brown in the picture? It's not. Two events unconnected. What's your point? you're one sick racist bitch You are a Peter Piper follower. Monkey see, monkey do. You're one sick stupid person. what point are you making about the photo? If this is real, I feel one of those AWESHIT moments coming on both sides, the neighborhood and the police. this is mike brown stop lying and get your facts straight next time you insult another HUMANS life He is large. In the store photos you have some prospective unlike the still photos. Take a look at college football players, roughly same size and maturity (in terms of looking older). my brother played, I'm familiar with their size That maybe he did try &amp; take cops gun though window (something witnesses could not see). This goes toward CHARACTER. üòê i'd be a bad witness Wow! I'm looking for his read hat and his flip flops can you find them? I didn't head you üëÇ I think is saying: tough guy in pic is low life scum whether it's the late Mr. Brown or not then what's the relevance? low life scum I think still unclear in the context of the shooting of an unarmed teen. But ok. 18 is an ADULT I said teen not child but again, how is the pic relevant? good piece of evidence to bad the officer was still wrong for murdering a strong armed robbery if there was a black person in an altercation in a convenience store, that totally justifies killing another black person, right? A black cop shot Mr. Brown if he is charged (it will be racist) there will be more riots. Wait, so why didn't we shoot down the ARMED (white) men who shot up theaters and schools? They killed themselves, Thugs are thugs whatever color they are. poor baby ""he din do nuffin"" lol Right now there is only one side out. I wonder if there was a dash cam, was it on? Mic?? That would help for sure. In 2014 no cameras?? That's a shame. I see the cams as a form of protection for both parties. Sure, but think about how useful they could be should someone be abused on either side. I hear ya though. I haven't but I just think it turns into a he said he/she said without them. um, they killed themself. WHENDUMBPEOPLETWEET James Holmes is still alive. So is the guy who shot a congresswomen in Az. Call me ""dumb"" all you want. Just realize that probably makes your tawdry, feeble-minded ass stupid (at best) in comparison. I see, and I'm sure she saw what she did. She did come in after the start. However, the store vid clearly shows.... That is the victim man handling the clerk. The SAME clothes and shoes. Not saying its ok to murder but everything... Needs to come out. AAAAAND this: the officer did not stop him because the store incident so this is all actually void. Don't you think? Are there reports of the officer receiving injuries? Thanks for that. I want to see photos if they were taken. They should have been. Release of the dispatch recordings might come out as well. no I'm sure the violent felon put his hands right up and the evil policeman after 6 yrs of service decided to kill 4 fun! are you afraid of admitting you're a racist? Are you afraid of being called a racist? race doesn't matter to me nor should it matter to this case. You are the racist. Facts don't matter 2u Just blindly follow the herd. you do a lot of bitching and whining, but never make any points. yep this picture proves he wasn't on his knees with his hands up. And the Mr Wilson didn't empty his gun on him. Nice work. lol read my heading. I don't concern myself with your opinion. Your a sheep. yes. I like your points. ""Your a racist! your a racist!"" Grow a brain.",1
MORE: #Ferguson police chief identifies Darren Wilson as cop who shot Michael Brown http://t.co/Qojlgp8mlc http://t.co/mwZBmZjAst," You should probably use this photo of him now. That photo has already been proven NOT to be Michael Brown. JESUS. FERGUSON So Brown wasn't ""nice young man"", but robber, assaulting store owner, and basically a thug? Hmmm... FERGUSON How would MO State Troopers have reacted if rioting &amp; looting last night? ? Is riot &amp; loot OK if people angry &amp; black! Doesn't matter if him was grounds for officer to stop bc of description. I guess you don't  care if that is him or not - anyone of them will do??? Sure, and shoot him while his hands were up multiple times?  I'm sure you're ok with that too. guess he can be shot too right? All good SARCASM Absolutely not ok with it. Now we need rest of what really happened. Some of witnesses lied. Some police officers lied too. No but officer doing duty by stopping him based on descript from c store. officer can stop him,if he runs,the officer can run him down, call for back up not shoot him dead. No but officer ok to stop him &amp; companion lied. No one knows the WHOLE story, but we do know now that he wasn‚Äôt a ‚ÄòGentle Giant', robbery shows this. Shocking. Two 18 year old shop lifters lied? Shoot em. No he can't but since witnesses lied shouldn't we wait for the rest of the story? So, if NBC is going to continue toting the line, least they can do is use a photo more descriptive of the day. He stole Swisher Sweets.  JESUS. My pastors son stole Mt. Dew. Shoot him too? Then let them answer for that too. I believe it will all come out now that Ferguson PD is not in charge. Nobody is saying that. He's wearing the same clothes as when he was shot. That is what happened. He is suspected of shoplifting he lied resisted arrest and he's dead. &amp; that warrants death? Furthermore death without trial? Nobody ok with shooting but as facts come out shows much more to story. yes - and they should have been more forthcoming -regardless innocent kid dead! They haven't been in charge since the beginning PC called for outside PD on way to scene. Police are never allowed to use deadly force unless lives are threatened. Kid was walking away. maybe the cop had your mindset?? Doesn't make it right Ferguson has a long history of police abuse. The DA controls info released. You wait until you have enough facts. Unlike media what does that mean? The cops should never shoot suspects unless their life is in danger. Bullshit. Now you are just toting progressive talking points. BLOCKED The DA lost control because they are being released now. Riiiiiiggghhttt. BTW you have already declared him innocent. were u there? Maybe you should wait for entire story! Please PEOPLE PEACE Are you Still Sure? I know another innocent unarmed young black man killed!! Am guessing investigation took longer to protect witnesses &amp; town was being burned. YES! In the U S of A you ARE INNOCENT until proven guilty by a jury of you peers. So with limited info you now read minds? Sorry for ur loss. U have same outrage when young white men are killed? Scott he may be right we have no info on that either. Although interviews with residents don't indicate that yet. ""I'm guessing"" is the definitive words in your tweet- you know nothing w/certainty I am white. What the hell difference does that make? He authorized the release of info. Now you're starting to babble. dont forget to mention darren wilson is BLACK Try google. Not hard to figure out. i have same outrage at injustice -coming from blended family-see both sides unlike you He authorized it after the Gov. and the President ""suggested it"". Jesus. oh yes there is a reliable source. Ur, blended. I'm white, stupid to think color matters. Unless it matters 2 them maybe You are absolutely correct. That includes the Police Officer right? They are police reports, so my guess, not reliable. Good point. when u take the side of black injustice many assume u must be black-look at protesters Absolutely, and fortunately no one has shot and killed him and he will have a trial. They assume I am a black man and I'm a white woman which always makes me chuckle. You're missing facts. County police took over investigation same night. Google it I understand that, but until the Gov and President got involved they were all D-bags. It's pointless trying to have an intelligent conversation with you. the chief was doing all the talking  - and saying nothing but will not release name Awwww, that's so cute. When you lose, you give up. You must be a white man. because he was removed from investigation. Unbelievable !!! Am i right? No 2 bad. Usually they are the ones that try to insult because they don't have a valid argument. I admit based on history with LE. Better than all ur assumptions. then why did he continue to speak? They try to bully their opinions to be right. It's very amusing actually. Wait. Was your come back ""my assumptions r better than ur assumptions"" None &amp; didn't ask but tells me alot re sympathies in these situations. Turns out MIKE Brown beat up store clerk,strong-arm robbery, beat up cop &amp; tried to get his gun, is gang member. Different picture Hell yes. Not only sypmathy but empathy. Breaks my heart to see children gunned down. Because DA kept sending him out there to take the heat. This is the politics I'm a bully now? Read the police report they released. They say it is him. Don't have outrage bc don't have all the facts. Looting cause loss of credibility. Often times the DA speaks. This DA is a cowardly douche bag in my opinion. I thought you weren't a white man? Wow we agree on something. Minus the name calling of course. Looting is a reaction to rage and very few people looted. Rage or desperation. OMG - have you watched when a ""nice"" university wins championship? I thought you weren't a racist? LOL.  They torch cars, burn buildings, but dude... that's ove a game so yeah! Except nobody cares your color looting &amp; rioting changes mentality of observers. Why did you think that? he b ullrushed tge cop..beat him in the face..tried for his gun and was shot! You seem obsessed with skin color. But that could just be an assumption. Does this video change your feeling about Ferguson PD? I am obsessed with how I see black Americans being treated. As a white person, it sickens me. it will all come out but cops should have told this within 24 hrs...I knew they robbed the store of cigars 3 days ago! No! He shot an innocent unarmed teenager-may not b racism but cultural FEAR were it your son -would you be so quick to ""understand"" a blk witness saw it all......brown was beating officer in his own car.... I heard shell casings were 35 ft from the car. I want the final report. Could be BS now that is one nutty assumption - can't teach an ..... New tricks! I'm out!!! It's 2014. I don't buy the fear thing. It's ignorance and stupidity. It's still criminal. Oh, so let's just call it even for Michael Brown then. WTFE. You're going to believe the people that did this? No but my ""understanding"" isn't based on racism. I thought tweet was re looting. Personal knowledge. Time to End Police Militarization Now! Time to End Police Militarization Now! No need to shoot him after when his hands were up! Time to End Police Militarization Now! Time to End Police Militarization Now! Time to End Police Militarization Now! can suck my nuts. The DHS under Obama has been funding this build up. I somewhat agree but if your facing a riot you want to be in riot gear. I am more concerned we end the militarization of the federal agencies! Did u see that the cop DID NOT know he was a suspect when he shot him? Yep, that is crazy. Good to know though. At least a little honesty.... Interesting to note P Chief says they did NOT know Michael was a suspect when they shot him. I think having Holder's office involved has encouraged the honesty. I have guns, funded by me.  I don't shoot people with them. Well according to the cops, they didn't know when they shot him. Y was he in the car in.The cop didn't even know about shoplifting. So now that the cops admit they didn't know about the shoplifting, what were those grounds again? I think you meant your lack of understanding. Think it's BS since the cops admit they didn't know about the shoplifting? Faced with a riot like this?",1
So basically #Ferguson PD hijacked what was supposed to be a press conference about Darren Wilson to call Michael Brown a criminal #NMOS14," and they wonder why we're mad no sir. It was a press conference to release info on the events that occurred including releasing cops name fuck that. This is NOT their investigation. They shouldn't have released anything but that officers name. PERIOD. wow..so u don't want them to release all the info? Just the info that favors mr brown? Please be fair liz they didn't say it was a good shooting liz, but don't be upset that they released more info. they should have released cops name ASAP, and also the robbery info ASAP. U can't argue w that Kyle, the PD smeared the poor boy and tried to walk away before even releasing the name of the officer, don't u see? I'm not arguing with that, the PD shit allll over this investigation then all over MIKEBROWN. If they had nothing to Liz releasing facts is not smearing him hide then they wouldn't have waited 6 days to release any info at all. And they do this after last night?? do what?? Release factual info as regards to the investigation?? What do u want? Info or not?? people say they want info released and just get mad if it doesn't favor their opinion???? I'm partial in all this.. Why can't other be? Don't be mad they don't release info, then they do..and ppl r upset? it's fact that info should be released sooner and that policy needs changed. yup, you got us Kyle. That's it. ding ding, you win the prize so ur saying if indeed he was involved in a robbery, that info should not be released? Do tell.. I'm saying don't release your side of the story, drop the mic and walk away, this boy was MURDERED, IDGAF if he robbed or not well he released the name..that's done. But why get upset that they release other info? I'm confused just stating facts And worse, it took 'em a week to come up with that half assed story. Exactly! It make it easier for whites to absorb that Mike Brown was a thug/criminal and rightly shot! If that is what they think they are wrong! Nat'l many 1000's all races protesting this. NOT THIS WHITE person! This whole thing is BS!! A man was shot multiple times with hands in the air,PERIOD Not this white person or millions of others across America.  This is finally transcending race. lol looks Police wants this MIKEBROWN case to avoid trial If the second witness interviewed holds up, that ship has sailed. Not going to happen. When they do give out the cops ID, he will be a law abiding angel But I can think of two recently arrested Journalists who just got themselves a hobby. Not claiming I'VE had same experience as a wh person,just saying I'm also OUTRAGED&amp;WANT JUSTICE FOR ALL! You don't have to.  Your outrage is welcome, and more to the point HELPS US ALL get justice. I do have some knowledge though as I'm married to a bl man and have a son I fear for greatly! Cop has no criminal/disciplinary record, they could say shooting was self-defence Doesn't matter.  You were good in my book from jump, no matter who you're married to. Here we are! My son has faced racial bullying to an extreme and was largely ignored by school! Let's see if that's actually true. Because Journalists just got themselves a new hobby. Our Pres has faced extreme racism from second he announced he was running for Pres. That's the real tragedy of racism. I happens to the highest and the lowest. Young and old... Racism alive and well in USA and it's DISGUSTING!MORE disgusting so many white ppl DENY this fact! It's true.  Just check Breitbart or Red State. Not all up all ups at you just up!Mlk & amp; malcolm x, medgar evers, etc. Did not die for this! It has to be dead in the water cos if it goes on trial they are roasted, VICTIMBLAMING I hope you didnt expect any thing more than that. Of course they were going to spin it Didn't see that one coming. I bet Michael Brown had marijuana in his system, too. They could have released this video Monday. Waiting to derail the alleged killer's name is deflection. FERGUSON I always expect the worse. Especially when it comes to cops justifying shooting unarmed men Maybe he was armed with skittles and a slab of concrete as well Exactly. sprinkling the crack around the murdered dead kid 7 days too late. talked to a 2nd witness last night. If her testimony holds up, Cop's roasted. Thank you. I can't believe this is STILL happening in 2014! Yeah they're dumping the whole bag out on that joint. This is wild I'd like to say neither do I, but...SMH Day Pres was elected I cried like a baby&amp;told my biracial son ""baby,NOW you really CAN be anything u want! BUT since that day I'd estimate about 30% or more of wh ppl in USA have lost their damn minds! TEANUTS Really. She might be targeted n arrested on some funny issue like jaywalking I'm sure the DOJ (who she's talked to) would just LOVE that coincidence. Oh,I know,wasn't saying it like it gave me permission to speak on issue, just that I've witnessed prob",1
"Assuming #MichaelBrown and #DorianJohnson were involved in robbery, when can we expect President Obama's apology to the #Ferguson PD?
#tcot"," Bersummit Ha! Never. OBAMA barely scraped together enough to make His press conference yesterday. He'll never retract. Why do you assume that? And if it's true, the reaction far outweighed the action. What should POTUS apologize for in this case? He was right about what he said about FERGUSON PD. You'd think ISIS was there. Community did not recognize the looters and rioters, but community was punished by police state. OBAMA was right ""on this one."" When we get his birth certificate ISIS buries ppl alive. Cut off heads. Crucify. Women. Children.At their worst 2 compare 2 Ferguson? IGNORANT that's what I want to know..and why does the race of the cop matter anyway?..that's RACISM how do you know it did..were you there?..I don't know..what facts do you have to state that? Please let me point out how ignorant &amp; illiterate you are. I'm not comparing FERGUSON to ISIS. I said... that you would think ISIS was in FERGUSON by HOW POLICE RESPONDED. Treating it like a 9/11 situation. Read the next time! Don't get me twisted. A distinction without a difference. I did read your words. You should choose them more carefully. I have heard from witnesses as well as the PD's version of events. Shooting an unarmed person over cigars? Who's ignorant now? witnesses were in their homes. seems he attacked cop went for a gun grab. don't make a thug a hero You straight up said you'd think ISIS was there. It's an ignorant (at BEST), comparison. Oh please, I didn't say anything about hero. It looks like excessive force, but I'm open minded. Let's wait and see. No, you're illiterate. Face your problem. Don't tweet me anymore. You are rebuked and blocked! Wow. Stupidity reigns! good. me too. what's pissing me off is it seems the cop MAY be black.awaiting confirmation. don't think that shud matter a cop, not matter his race has a right to defend himself against attack.. There's tension between blacks &amp; police in area. If Brown had his hands up, unarmed, he shouldn't have been shot. If there was a shot fired in the car, there didn't need to be more shooting when Brown fled. He was already wounded. Larry, maybe we should wait until after the funeral to start calling the man a criminal you really believe that? cops are known for executing blacks in broad daylight right? be concerned bout Chicago in the real world..you go for a cops gun..you're probably going to get smoked..no matter race..stop with the black privilege We have a LEGAL system. Cops not supposed to find and shoot the suspect. Even ARMED suspect not to be executed by cops. Right?! If the police backed off, &amp; let outsiders burn Ferguson down, you'd be whining about that too. Violence is met. I'm middle-aged, white, a cop put me in handcuffs, jail, for ""tailgating."" Sometimes a-holes are just a-holes. why would he apologize to Ferguson PD? They still reacted with over militarized force to peaceful protesters! But we haven't seen any evidence for that and Brown was clearly unarmed when he was shot after leaving the car. even if he was involved, in America you are still supposed to be innocent until proven guilty by trial of your peers but I forgot that the Constitution doesn't matter anymore anyway. Dems keep using The Vetting Company that 'Vetted' Obama What did they expect ! A police officer is not judge, jury, and executioner. CNN spinning, says Michael Brown was a ""shopping challenged teen"" and was robbing stores to pay for college. I thought you said you were waiting for the completion of the investigation?..so far kid was a Blood's Thug.. The reaction DID outweigh the circumstances! It's NOT a white vs black issue. It's a Police State issue! what's wrong with you? tell your children to pull their pants up. finish school, don't join gangs. what so hard with that? 400 years of oppression that I'm sure in you reply to this you will deny. Because of NADA that Obama  Signed how has ur slave mentality helped u? stop w/the victimhood..its tiring, old. it's not a blk/wht issue. it's a law/order issue Why do ghettos exist? this Country is 237 years old..do you know that? Not that it's any consolation, but nearly all nations and peoples have participated in slavery throughout history. That's how old the Constitution is. The first Europeans settled here with slaves 1619. Even Africans held slaves. Not saying it was right. It's just not relevant anymore. Past is gone. Slavery is only the beginning. Blacks are still second class citizens. why do some in call successful blacks who call for self determination, reliance uncle toms..why not look to them as leaders? Not in most peoples minds. Look at all the great black leaders, West, Carson, both probably running for president Africans sold the slaves.. and since white people make up the greater majority it would have been impossible for Obama to be POTUS w/o them 1. I tell you the truth, what you project is what you get back. If you act a leader you'll be perceived as one. muslims still own MILLIONS..but cops are the sworn enemy..go figure..then some wonder why it's enough already 2. victims portray weakness and really are repulsive. you've created that class for yourself and revel in it..no one can help with that..only you Did U C the black MO. HP officer speaking. Now there's a leader. I'm watching..and if this guy was a blood thug..their community is better off with this criminal dead.. White people schooling blacks on race relations, is like me schooling Stephen Hawking about science. U mean as in the gang ""bloods""? is that why their wearing red handkerchiefs yes..a whole page of shooting gang signs..upstanding citizen..this is their hero see?..just our subsidies are good. get the PD out of your neighborhoods and police yourselves..call for that The tides have turned for white males. we're discriminated for last 15 yrs. increasingly-but I'm not whining No one said Mike Brown was a hero, why do you keep repeating that? yep..but this what some will call saint mike..no one can help that mentality.. Look at all the corporations and governments that white men don't run anymore... Oh wait! DELUSIONAL You're completely missing the point if you think anyone is calling him a hero or a saint. OK. let's do it ur way. we'll give em all to you and u give all the profits 2 poor people and watch the corps. die problem w/ socialism is soon you run out of other peoples money because you keep defending his actions by continually trying to paint his as a victim while he's a perpetrator guess what..bet they graduated high school first..why do so many drop out? There he goes...shooting his mouth off again ...I thought he learned something at the Beer Summit. Now you're just making things up. I never said a word about socialism. I can condemn the actions of the police without condoning the actions of Mike Brown. the PD did that community a favor..I don't expect you to see that tho..you need crisis to affirm your racism No soup for you RT: Now you're just making things up. I never said a word about socialism. hahahahaha You all need to stop assuming that you know what it's like to be black, Asian, female, a Muslim, or whomever else. All you know is what it's like to be you. So listen when someone shares their experiences. I've been listening for decades..it's time to evolve and grow..stop blaming, start acting..no charge for that now that makes no sense.. I grew up in SF. 1 of 3 whites integrated 2 worst ghetto in hunters point. talk about racism. jumped several times A real dialogue can never begin if you refuse to acknowledge that blacks are 2nd class citizens. Good day sirs. A) Looting is a lawful shoot (B) BHO apologize 4 f'in up, that would be a 1st. took martial arts and did something about it. u don't see me whining over how poorly i was treated in a ghetto Victims never recover-its a law of life. I feel sorry for you..someday, you'll see how it's not working for you.. Obama Spoke Stupidly. Imagine if your experience there was the entire country. No escaping being treated lesser than your whole life. that's on you..that's how you feel about yourself..sorry..but this is old..gotta go actually it was my entire childhood. whites were hated by all minorities, chinese, latins, and so on. but so what? don't hold your breath Larry! Hell,CNNs Don Lemming is trying to restart the rioting! He should be charged with inciting a riot! u get out of it by rising above it. not putting energy into darkness. it only fuels more darkness. So, you're saying's experience in the hood was his fault because of how he felt about himself? it really is a choice, a mindset. UR going to feel angry as long as u perceive this to b  ur reality. truth is most people i know aren't racist i wasn't raised that way, nor were my friends. we just didn't even think about it. though we were persecuted for you missed the rest..doesn't surprise me..he picked himself up..why don't you?..oh right..you're black.. That's much easier when you skin tone is the dominant one in society. being white. we just wondered what did we do to justify this. it was an old projection put on us for things we didn't even do. people before me may have but those days are gone and rejected by most sane people like hell it was easy. it was anything but that. i just didn't let it be my destiny. I said it was easier but you want to argue even though you have no idea what it's like to be black. the world ur thinking of doesn't exist in USA in vast majority of places. if it does, there ignorant dumb shits wether black, white, yellow or brown. it crosses both ways. and it is not race specific. the tides may turn but it's mind blowing how ignorant people are. I'm over this. You need to wake up. that is relative w/ time and cultures. now christians are being persecuted by insane monsters for there beliefs. what did they do/ peaceful people. tides turn. how come the black people i know don't hold your views? ur black and what else, a woman, a muslim, a christian, a vampire what else? What view are you speaking of? same here..they're embarrassed by ferguson they don't feel persecuted, or oppressed. they have it great in the best country on earth. they make something of their lives. who's holding you back? we have laws against racism. they actually keep many white people from getting jobs. the WOE'S ME..is holding some back.. I would like to talk to your black friends. Hook me up. that's ok tho..b/c blacks can't be racist.. it's like the alcoholic saying, 'poor poor me, pour me another drink"" What's holding all of mankind back is arrogant ignorant attitudes like yours. she wants to talk to our black friends so she could call them uncle tom's..watch out oh please..it's enough.. go watch news. fact the guy was a thug will not stop this from being a race issue..what's wrong w/some ppl? not getting anywhere here. talk later cos. same here..that slave mentality pays too well.. You have a Master mentality. You're absolutely right, ignorance isn't going to get you anywhere. U win.Have a bad day. that was actually pretty funny cos. lol this is why the race card has to be denied..no one can help some..no responsibility for own actions Was b4 Obama signed NDAA nullifying the bill ofRights Now UR not evenprotectedSelf incrimination No taking 5th I'm responsible for MY actions, not others. But, you refuse to admit that some white people commit racist actions. MICHAELBROWN DORIANJOHNSON FERGUSON TCOT .....ha ha ha -don't hold your breathe",1
Arrived in Crestwood where officer Darren Wilson lives. When I knocked police officer rolled up and told me Wilson left days ago #Ferguson," you should work for tmz they gave him a head start. When will we find out what ""injuries"" he had? FERGUSON MT: Arrived in Crestwood where officer Darren Wilson lives. Police officer rolled up and told me Wilson left days ago How can he leave?  He's a suspect in an on going investigation. where is the picture? Don't the County munys have the same residency requirements as the City? I would leave too if a mob was screaming for my head before all the facts came out. I think it depends on the city, but it appears no for Ferguson. Ferguson cops aren't required to live in community they serve? Huh.RT: Arrived in Crestwood where officer Darren Wilson lives. Isn't he a suspect? Where r the pics of his ""injuries""? What's his record? Any previous disciplinary actions or investigations? If it's the Darren Wilson from SLMPD, his FB shows him in California I'm not sure how many municipalities require the officers to live in town. Ferguson PD is not SLMPD. Gosh Bob, you're the reporter, right? How about getting back to us when you find out. That would be great. Good question. Have been in Chicago so long I assumed it was more common, and who knows whether it've made a difference. I know that.... does anyone have personnel data for Ofc Wilson in Ferguson? this requirement is rare in MO because there are 100+ municipalities all packed in to St Louis County. Here's what the FOP says on the topic: Hey, you know, I have other *paid* work to do. I'm sure you have a lot on your plate. It's not like residency fosters empathy or anything. We're just curious Indeed, the cynics say Chicago‚Äôs rules (also for teachers, librarians) exist solely to prop up home values. By all means, listen to these hypothetical cynics you mention. They sound very knowledgeable. Does that surprise anyone-figured they'd get him far out of town b/4 IDing him Thank you! I wanna know more about DARRENWILSON I'm following you! The first journalist to share some real info abt him! yup following as well Or walk a beat. people screamed for Zimmermans head. That Zionist piece of shit is still walking the streets.  Stfu. Sure they did, they already know how people do what they claim they hate,judge, jury executioner Can you please give me an example of police accused of brutality who have been assaulted in last decade Can you please give me an example of a white person who has been lynched in the last century As soon as you give me an example of a cop who fled and never returned for an investigation, or court! Is everything about race to you. I didn't mention race. yes. everything is about race to me. Why would you knock on his door? Didja think he'd invite you in for tea? Fucking hyena Hahahahahahahahahahaha.He's just sitting at home in a bath robe.What a dummy. Oh hello, sir. Sure come on in, ask away. What an idiot Of course it is because you only see skin color not character! Of which your is questionable! Still waiting for the name of the cop who fled never to be seen again! Oh wow. I wasn't expecting anyone to be interested in talking to me. This comes as quite a shock. I never said Zimmerman was smart. You missed the part at the press conference where they said he's been at a ""secure location"" since the shooting, huh? how convenient for killer-cop Darren Wilson no? Thin Blue Line protects him long enough for him to flee &amp; avoid public scrutiny. and still gettting paid. Did you seriously this he'd be there? good question. They've been pretty vague this far. Wilson's probably hiding in the attic. He's in Mexico, drinking margaritas.",1

You're cramping our style! Signed, Ferguson PD red ball cap was in the street. Sandals probably came off. Check out the socks. (Note: none of this justifies the shooting or killing, just answering the question.) tragic that authorities stoop to such depths-shameful. I think so noted. No it doesnt Are you saying he's not smart enough to discard/hide evidence... because he's black? Shame on you. /s Thank u. Now, FERGUSON cops have given themselves time to build a story! Teen w/hands up SHOT?!! Its the same sandals, his hat is on the ground.  His friend is a liar.  Your wrong sorry, look at more photos and videos. in the street where??? I'll wait are YOU saying officer was dumb enough 2 approach robbery suspects by saying ""get the fuck on the sidewalk""? they showed it lying in the street on the news what am I missing. What statement came out today the PD are making this story up as they go along, but they have a few major problems:  eye witnesses RT QTNA || If MIKEBROWN is indeed the robber, where‚Äôs the red ball cap? Sandals? Stolen cigars? FERGUSON I'm just glad to see the improvements since the State Troopers took over. Things were bad on both sides and ""if"", then why hasn't Dorian been arrested? even if it was him that doesn't justify the killing. His life really valued less than that of a pack of swishers. One buck oh absolutely. Not arguing that! he wasn't a kid... None really knew if he was armed or not until they took him away. Besides all I am saying is Picts were released to help explain a situation. Some want the off name I and most others want facts / proof Lawyer says that Brown's friend confirms that he did take the cigarillos (via. MSNBC) hmmm cigars are worth more than a human life. That sucks Facts would be releasing info about the killing, not an entirely different crime. wear your best I ‚ù§Ô∏è Surveillance teeINTERNTNL WAVE AT SURVEILLANCE DAY tomorrowüôãWAVEDAY You didn't get any facts or proof as all this would prove is that he stole cigars. Has no relation on the death. yes those would be the facts I am talking about... Or a vid of what happened from all the witness's that saw it. not justifying shooting. informing that Brown's lawyer is already fucking up the case. This lawyer let Zimmerman walk free. Well I think we vs all hopefully agree that releasing this info about stolen cigars was completely useless. so you think it is him in the store? I can't tell so no opinion there. The Chief didn't say it was him either. So... you didn't answer so I will take that as acknowledgment that their version doesn't make sense to you either back to my initial tweet... What does that have to do with it he was being sarcastic. chill and leave me out of this please. I haven't been reading much of the news on this. Everyone has an agenda &amp; will believe whatever suits them no it's not useless. It explains what had been put officers mind. May have been why he attempted to make contact with Brown in the first place. ""May have"" with everything reg this it's all assumption. What happens when u assume no he was being racist.  Not sarcastic and get over yourself.  Your handle was in the pre-existing convo. Bye /s means sarcasm genius. your misplaced anger and self righteousness needs to be put in check. they panicked because of the witnesses so they forgot to plant the evidence or couldn't plant it. so his lame attempt at sarcasm was still racist. Too dumb because he's black?  Go be goofy elsewhere. We can all play armchair detective. But we'll impact more change by using the right methods to call for transparency in police Also, ""taking my goofiness elsewhere"" is a funny thing to say on twitter. Hope it didn't ruin your day your lack of english comprehension is unsettling. as is your unwarranted aggression and eagerness to label ""racists"" go be bitchy somewhere else. you might wanna report and block her cuz she is on the self righteous everyone is racist war path.",1
It appears that #Ferguson PD are trying to assassinate Mike Brown's character after literally assassinating Mike Brown.," How? They are giving info that the media asked for. They are releasing irrelevant info that doesn't affect the case of Michael Brown's shooting also wrong venues and in wrong order. After his summary execution in the street, they are trying him through the media. What case? It's totally cool to shoot unarmed people suspected of a crime! and that is part of what's distressing. Police screw up and make bad decisions in any system. to have the Supreme Court declare open season for cops on the population is a deliberate decision. They can't release shooting info cause they are still interviewing witnesses. Media wanted this info. They can't tie the two together cause they are separate issues. Releasing at different times puts distance between them. Are you saying they start at the end and don't explain why he was approached by cops? I'm curious, had the suspect been white would the PD have acted the same? p sure you know the answer to that question. For you to declare he was executed without any facts is also as absurd. I don't think i did say that. I did criticize a Supreme Court decision I've read many times. and not releasing any facts is a real good way to make sure people pass judgment on the facts they have Not releasing facts about that shooting is also a way to make sure they get good info from witnesses. What they did today was also a good way to taint the jury pool. P Much And that's the point. That's what people are upset about, I think. That's two different arguments. it's also pretty upsetting that a kid was summarily executed for maybe stealing a pack of cigars. they've systematically only released information that makes them look good, even info that might taint the investigation (e.g., that officer had a facial injury). Agree. Not worth the bullets whatsoever. I don't understand the double standard of wanting all the info about the cop but Brown's past is safe. it is! I both argued that the Supreme Court was wrong . . . Also per last press conf, local PD depts seem super disconnected and out of touch with African American community. and that suppressing or selectively releasing info led to people deciding for themselves. What other info do they have ready to release? All they have said is this is why we approached him. Why wasn't Dorian Johnson arrested if he was suspected of a robbery? I believe I read something like Ferguson is 29% white but the PD is 94% white. an investigative report on the shooting? White or Black the biggest prob people have with police is the attitude from cops. We are a guilty till proven innocent society. strongly agree. I know policing is a terribly high-stress job, but most people are not criminals. Perhaps they need to alter/improve their training. What they also did was chose to not ignore facts that call in to question the witness' credibility. He admitted they stole cigars to DOJ &amp; StL County PD. He wasn't charged b/c he didn't commit a crime. There are several witnesses. They don't all know each other and they're all saying the same things. You don't want to see what's happening? Fine. Keep being naive. Good day. I see a lot of people making assumptions with limited facts. We haven't even seen an autopsy report. Ok, so you get accounts from the community he lives in where people already have a distrust in police and you want to make a decision without any hard facts. why don't you check out the racial profiling statistics of the Ferguson PD? some real, hard facts. then tell me the people of Ferguson haven't EARNED some distrust. autopsy report SPOILER alert: died from multiple gunshot wounds That right there tells me you are going into this with an agenda. that I don't like racial profiling and think police should obey the law? That is definitely my agenda. Was he shot in the chest or back? From 35' away or 3' away? Which wounds came first? Lol everyone agrees he was shot once at close range and multiple times at 30+ feet. They've already said he shot him once from the car. Christ. Right there you just admired they are all bad witnesses if they have distrusts in cops. this turned out to be a very popular tweet No that you see this as a racial situation before you know anything. it sure did. A boon to my BRAND If he was shot in the chest or back is the biggest factor in who is right. What? No it isn't. There is definitely no justification for deadly force once he was running. in your world, it's cool to shoot unarmed people in the chest, but not the back? Or vice versa? Rand Paul, yesterday:  ""Anyone who thinks race does not skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention."" If he was shot in the chest how was he running away? If he was shot in the back he was running away but shot in the chest he could have been charging. Anybody who uses it at every opportunity falsely weakens the message. Yeah, I would totally expect a kid that's been shot to run away, get shot again, and decide to charge. who says it's false? There's a large &amp; documented history of this PD arresting too many blacks. Rand Paul used those words BECAUSE of this incident. Just fuck off dude. Fuck off so hard. Has that info came out yet? You're making an assumption about something based on other peoples actions, that's my point. confused how an unarmed person, charging, retreating, or standing still, is a threat to a cop 30' away Simple: Mike Brown was Inspector Gadget. Did you see him stand 30' away and get shot? No. A few people who have a problem with cops did. do you not even have a basic understanding why people mistrust police? per chief belmar: ""a shot was fired inside the car, and Brown was eventually shot about 35 feet away from the vehicle."" that's an account FROM THE STL CO POLICE CHIEF I'm relying on details agreed upon by the police and the witnesses. I blocked him, so you can leave me off the tweets. I won't see them, gives you more characters. I do, but do you have a basic understanding of the judicial system? Let's hear both sides then decide. OK And there was a struggle inside the car. How do we know Brown didn't get the gun and fire the shot during the struggle? why would the ferguson PD and STLCO PD release the information they've released and fail to mention that? They didn't say who fired the shots in the car. The fact is we've only heard one side. there's a difference between an open mind and an empty one dude, come on. This rogue cop apparently thought he was Judge Dredd and murdered an unarmed kid. So no matter that evidence comes out during the investigation that's what you're going with? An open mind waits for all the facts then decides. An empty one makes a decision before the investigation is over. Unsubscribe",1
"Even if #MikeBrown was running down the street with a bag full of boosted goods, he deserved a trial. Not a street execution. #Ferguson"," proof?  That an unarmed person was shot dead... A friendly reminder that is human garbage. Sure, Defend 10 Bullets in an Unarmed Person.Maybe Make Friends and Get Someone Arrested,.GTFO. He's ""human garbage"" because he is saying something rational? Google Brandon Darby. Lol, broad beard. Breitbart came after the ""entrapped people in NOLA for FBI"" part of's life. naw, because he is a snitch. Ill just leave this here for you, Darby. I say that about the 100's of innocent teens in Chicago being killed each week by teens, it's a cultural problem. Charmer. He helped the FBI arrest some criminals and domestic terrorists?  Way to go! Snitching on extremists who want to firebomb the GOP convention.  Hell I'm all for that. Evil must be stopped. Another ignorant anarchist using the stupid Guy Fawkes mask. Pick up a history book and learn who Guy Fawkes was. Tire of ignorance. Lolwtf? Who has a guy Fawkes mask? No one in this thread is flying a Fawkes. Check your Twitter banner.  headslap Howdy has it as his banner. That's a Paypal14 banner, but I do see the aforementioned Fawkes lol Well that makes a bit more sense. Though my support of pp14 is irrelevant here. Just pointing out the ignorance and hypocrisy of using Guy Fawkes. Ignorance and hypocrisy which is illustrated in this entire convo. You've seen no ignorance or hypocrisy from me, at all. And I'm far from Anonymous, despite my support for some of them. Try harder. That was directed toward the Anarchist flying the stupid GF mask. I'm a Libertarian who hates it when fellow libertarians use that idiot thing. GF was the opposite of Libertarian &amp; Anarchist was for theocratic dictatorship you're not a fucking libertarian. You're just another big government conservative. Off original topic, but yes. I still support PayPal14, but back to original topic Not defending, but you are aware the mask is aligned with a movie, not history? Don't worry about it. All they're good at is name calling. ROFL, this is the kind of ignorance I was talking about. Because I say that if a person assaults a cop the cop has a right to defend himself I'm supposedly NOT a libertarian. rofl It is used as an anti-government symbol. You are aware of that right? And it is a face that belonged to a real person who was pro-religious dictator I don't think Anonymous is specifically antigovernment, but I am not them, either. Fawkes wasn't a dictator roflwat Fawkes supported placing a Catholic King on the throne to create a dictator Snag a history book that addresses this. Study up on the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 Ok, I'm uneducated, cool. Fawkes: Anarchist No, Libertarian No, supporter of theocratic dictatorship yes. On this topic it seems you are. Fawkes was a religious zealot. Lol congrats on successfully derailing this topic from snitching to Gunpowder Plot I responded to the snitch bull shit, which was not the origins of the topic. The snitch stupidity was used to derail from the points the guy was making. A religious zealot does not a dictator make. Your focal point is flawed. He helped the FBI take down evil people. That's a good thing. The topic of this thread is the extrajudicial killing of an unarmed man. He tried to blow up Parliament to put in place a religious dictator. So yes. My mentions are being blown up harder than Guy tried to blow up Parliament so, done Or is it the self defense of an officer who was defending against a criminal? We honestly don't know at this point. Facts looks bad for Brown supporters Hey,, would you ask to unblock me? Not sure why she did, but I wanna follow To the point of murder? There's a difference between self defense and intentionally shooting an unarmed kid multiple times. An unarmed kid who is nearly 7' tall, incredibly strong and was reported to have assaulted and robbed a store... A huge ""kid"" who is then accused of assaulting a police officer. I don't know who is right in this and neither do u. Both have a presumption of innocence. The cop may be a murderer or he may have been defending himself. That I can agree with but I can not agree with any justification for a life to be taken away. He was surrendering with his hands up, yet he was shot to the point of death and because he committed this crime, rather than be arrested, he was killed. There are 2 stories here. 1 he was surrendering and was murdered. 2 he was assaulting the cop trying to take his gun 1, the cop is a murderer... 2 the cop was defending his own life.  A big difference and you weren't there. I'm sincerely curious as to why this information came out at this point of time.  Aren't you? Sort of. We should not have any of the information from the investigation. It hinders a fair trial. you gat nothing to say better STFU..Retard Fag Boosted goods don't shoot or threaten public or cop. Inexcusable to shoot kid. PERIOD. Charge officer. Congrats on your 250‚òÖ tweet!",1
WATCH: Surveillance Video of Strong-Arm Robbery Linked to Michael Brown #Ferguson http://t.co/6fjtzxU063," and the truth comes out. yet he was this innocent upstanding young man. Give me a break. Just another thug. But, untimely deaths of US Veterans surely is ... get back to that please! Video does not show the instance that all the stills are from Why was the suspect in the video wearing different clothes &amp; shoes than Michael Brown? Yea thats some strong arm robbery. He pushed a guy out of his way. Shoplifting should be his only charge. But hes dead.... Hopefully if your kids are ever caught shoplifting, they are executed on the spot. Bullet right to the head. To and her racist Faux News colleagues, all black kids look alike. FERGUSON MICHAELBROWN irrelevant cause it wasn't him, stop sensationalizing the news. Once a fleeing-felon surrenders u can not kill him/her so however you slice it, its still Murder! all it shows is Prob Cause. so u fucks thing he DESERVED to get killed for takin a cigar WTF COP DIDNT KNOW he was just on patrol n killed the kid 4no reason just when the media was about to cannonize him like Saint Skittles FERGUSON Amazing how little truth is needed to dispel hysterical hatred being projected. Evil overwhelming good is always a denial of God. So the police release this and not the incident report from the shooting and and fox hop on it like it was a ding dong FERGUSON Soooo petty theft is justification for public execution in America? Ok, got it thanks! FERGUSON This us America. Not middle eastern countries where the consequence of theft us death. FERGUSON. WE WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING FERGUSONMIKEBROWN WAS MURDERED A/M A WEEK AGO! THERE IS A COVER UP GOING ON IN FERGUSON BS Heard about this. Thanx for post. Don't like blowups before facts are known. Or afterward! Wrong. The truth hasn't come out. Ballistics reports. Autopsies, etc. Do we even have a FCC? And shaved his face... Oh,  and the cop never radioed in that he was pursuing a robbery suspect... So odd. YOU ALL COVERED THE COLORADO MASS SHOOTERDIFFERENTLY~BRILLIANT SCIENTIST YOU ARE PAINTINGMIKEBROWN AS  A CRIMINAL WTF again...So petty theft justifies execution style murder in America? FERGUSON. Please clarify the relevance... I am not shocked ferguson waronblackmalesby racistcops Cleveland 13racistcops murdered2unarmedblacks KKK Is that a reason to execute him?FERGUSON and Saint Skittles? Wow mock the dead much? CLASSY the kid was not as innocent as everyone was making him out to be. The investigation is on going and no one knows the truth just. They have already murdered this young man, now you will assassinate his character too? FERGUSON not abt robbery anymore; it's about militaristic tactics against American citizens - btw, US law: innocent until proven guilty They say this isn't relevant and an attack on his character?  Uh, its completely relevant! This would come up in court everytime. who gets gunned down when surrendering NICE who had his hands up surrendering They say they want transparency and truth?  But not this...no no.  That truth isn't relevant.......geez. but shooting &amp; killing an unarmed suspect who is surrendering IS NEWS ISSUE not to mention COVERUP VA issues have been around since VietNam - do you know RONKOVIC story ? still happening Policeman shot, killed an unarmed suspect who was surrendering TRUTH I believe the constitution states, INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY ASSHOLE thank you for proving my precise point. Let's let the evidence speak. If this was some white tea bag rancher w/ a gun I wonder what the would narrative be? Would he be a ""patriot"" ? UM: Compare the video to the corpse photos. SHOES people. Obviously not the same people: sandals vs tennis shoes. SHOES!!! My mistake, yes - cool heads can wait for truth If the boy or the cop was a rancher?  Patriot?  Nobody should shoot anyone for no reason. Does Facebook Pay You To Post Photos &amp; Selfies? Leaf it will: Tape is from June, not August. Except he was stopped for jaywalking, per MULTIPLE witness accounts. They were still looking for suspect 7hr aftr murder Racist as fuck, also tape is from June not August. If MICHAELBROWN had been a white tea party rancher, even armed would be singing a different tune. yet we've already convicted the police 4 wrong doing. They're just guilty. Walk right up &amp; shoot ppl. Makes no since either way. Even if the incident occurred. $30 in Swisher sweets doesn't merit murder by cop. Ok, so I'm not the only one 'seeing things'. you being a law professional, you know that's not strong-Arm robbery call it what it is. .....shoplifting You're not Fam we can smell the bullshit Surrendering? I find that extremely hard to believe with the officer approaching Brown about J walking not stolen Swisher Sweets I didn't know the trial and verdict was complete. oh so this is how America justifies his killing üëç good job guys I disagree. We have convicted them for deploying tanks and blocking 1st amendment rights to peaceably assemble. ?????? Looting is peaceable I do.  I know Atomic Veterans and loved ones personally who have been denied VA justice dating back to start of Feres Doc Why weren't both the boys shot? If truly race related why leave one alive. just a waiting game for truth. Sad all the way around so everyone here who is saying support the cops what were you saying when Cliven bundy had guns pointed at cops? Will we ever really know the truth. After Chief said cop didn't know he was suspect ... I recant. Good point but what does that have to do with MIKEBROWN unarmed execution? Robbery is not punishable by execution and yet the chief of police said i didn't even know he was a suspect and he was stopped for jaywalking let's remember the fact that the cops were looking for the robbery suspect 7HOURS after brown was shot Beating? He shoved him once and walked out  FERGUSON walking down the street is not a crime. as per report mike didn't fit the description but hey just look at the pics I mean if you can change shoes shorts  hats and lose about 50 lbs in a tad maybe cops should be worried but then again cops in same town beat a man and arrested him for bleeding on them Pigs will do anything to protect their own. STANDWITHFERGUSON JUSTICEFORMIKEBROWN Media will do anything to paint POC as thugs. No correlation between surveillance tape+murder, yet was released anyway. Well, if that was the case...you can bet they would have stated he was a suspect before the confrontation as pretext. If they were smart they wouldve, they started with like 3 different stories, came up with this same day as name release. They jumbled their stories and now all eyes are on them. Such a tragedy. No reason for that boy to be publicly executed. Incredible. We are supposed to ignore that though. He was a good kid. Ya know, Inside. Ridiculous. Whatever! yes homework versus robbing store is prob better way to start ones day. tony, I'm sorry but did you look at this video? Pretty sure it looks like Mike! no it does not justify it but stop trying to paint a picture police officer just shot him for no reason. kid was a thug punk. Resisted arrest, pushed cop in car, went for gun, then cop lost it. that isn't execution. It's a cop who prob was freaked out. bottom line, punk 18 year old man, not kid, should be doing other things besides stealing cigars! I just saw it and yes I was wrong it is him however shoving a man dosent warrant being shot esp because as it has been said he got on his knees put his hands up and said don't shoot I don't at all dispute that, but did he really? Was that made up? How do you know? more then one witness has described the same story In the same way if you know a cop, talk to them, I'm amazed more don't lose it in situations. and if it did happen like that, he will be punished. The cop lost his mind. his hands were up; international symbol - even used in Wild West guy was unarmed - guy is dead - policeman pulled trigger CASECLOSED then you must be as frustrated as - and as long as - me. UNbelievable how the issue is a political pawn to love &amp; hate at will video/crime is not issue now - unfortunately bcuz now a policeman has killed an unarmed individual; armed robber poss still free Freak out while he shot him in the back? Sounds like EXECUTION FERGUSON Petty theft is a reason to shoot an unarmed person in America? Ok got it! EXECUTION FERGUSON MIKEBROWN agree we should know by now the entry point of the bullets if it's in his back the cop is done Yup. The officer was just profiling them for Walking While Black. I don't know what tune she is singing, other than seeking facts. Cops do not have to see a weapon to justify force.  U don't frick around when wrestling a cop.  We don't know the facts yet. um, can cops justify shooting an individual who has his hands up while shouting, ""Don't Shoot"" ? and yes, thank you - agreed we don't know the facts yet. Again, wedon't know what happened. One TV interview doesn't cut it quite yet. But if that's the case, then the cop is in big trouble I hope that's a joke, facts from fox? Hilarious! Ok...bye.  Reasonable discussion isn't your thing.  And hearing one side of the story is how you judge a court? Well no wonder that cop shot him 9 times while he had his hands raised.  He was a cigarillo thief and obviously a hardened thug! Facts and ""Fox News"" is an oxymoron. U have anything of substance to add?  Or is this a ""is so"" ""is not"" discussion? Greta The Full Truth Must Be seen You mean those useless idiots who freaked out over Janet Jackson's nipple? FCC I stated a fact.  If you can't grasp that, there's no way I can get you to understand. I think I'm past frustration and fighting for others and change is what keeps me focus these days. VA Scandal should have united US. no it certainly does not. Unfortunately pushing and shoving a man is what started this. I'd bet u can't name one example.  And all news outlets have made errors.  Have u ever made a mistake? I've never made a mistake.  There was this one time though when I thought I'd made a mistake but I was mistaken. Haha.  That's a good response.  Take care. You take care too.  T'was fun!  :) Thank you! You got it. Nancy Grace didn't pay a dime for her nip slip that looked delib-er-it. It's the cops job to respond...politics has nothing to do with it. What a bunch of nonsense.",1
New link: #Ferguson police release video they say shows a robbery involving #MichaelBrown: http://t.co/GMDuU33oed http://t.co/RaAWvjcWNu," where is the robbery? All I see is a confrontation. oh please CNN cut the bullshitüòíüòí them dirty ass cops will say anything wheres the money if he robbed the place looks like a soda in that persons handüò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥ they found his red cap in the middle of the street and thats why people are jumping to the conclusion that it was him Doesn't matter. Cop still murdered him. We won't be distracted. Nothing in that video provides concrete evidence of anything,much less any kind of justification for cops murdering anyone. wouldn't hurt a fly I'm sure lol SMH He din do nuffin, he good boy he was on his way to college, just needed to get some blunt wraps on the way. he robbed swishers supposedly I'm sure he wasn't just like trayvon Martin wasn't that's what I'm saying! why don't they do an analysis to determine whether it's him or not instead of just making assumptions bc they're both black yeah it's ridiculous so robbery can only be with money?Every time a black kid gets shot, all the black people say""He wasnt in the wrong"" That's a defense excuse when they can't defend their opinion logically. SMH so they killed him for stealing chips and juice gtfohüòí point is he was unarmed üòíüò¥üòí word, took a bullet for some swishers -.- we'll never know the whole story though did he deserve to die though? You do realize he didnt get shot because of that robbery? He was shot during protests and riots. exactly they looking for an excuse Perhaps People act like he was shot because he was black, but if it was a white kid or a black cop no one would care. there doesnt have to be money stolen/ just stolen itemsto be a robbery, they said it is robbery bc the use of force then why accuse him of a robbery if thats not why they killed him? Whats the point of bringing it up.. I wasn't there either. All I know is that in situations like this it take two to dance. to make him he look like a thug ? üò¥ Unless he was suicidal or something than that's different. right question who initiated it and since he robbed a store he's already the guilty party to make him look like the bad guy.. Since there is no real reason for why they did it. ""witnesses"" have about 10 different story's rather he was orange , purple or grey they  dead ass wrong ... If it were your relative u would feel different . Yes which from the video, he looks like thug. They are trying to make it seem like he could have done something to the cop It was to show his mentality. To prove that he isn't as innocent as anyone thought he was. oh please even if he jacked the cop up they have other weapons besides a gun the cop shouldnt have shot him. but just because he was black people care. people kill each other everyday because someone the picture isnt clear that could be anybody stepped in the wrong part of town, but just because cop shot someone its bad. get over it. I heard that he tried to grab the officers gun? Is this true? exactly who knows this wouldn't have happened if he didn't Rob a store tho So if someone was coming at you and beating the fuck out of you threating your life, you wouldnt shoot them if you could? he had no reason to shoot an unarmed person u sound ignorant üò¥ enjoy ya day‚úåÔ∏è Well robbing a store is one thing. If he wasn't armed than that could have gotten taken care of without risk to his life. thats not what i was referring to, i was just saying it doesnt have to be money to be a robbery Fists are weapons, he could have done anything at anytime he did what he thought was right he has a family to go home to you all can go to hell. No one deserves to get shot for anything including if i were a cop &amp; he was unarmed ummm hello .. So he must've left his taser in the car ... ? he felt threatened so he took action, not saying hes in the right but that what happen stealing police wouldn't shoot him if he didn't at least have a struggle with the cop he resisted arrest and the worst happened the cop didnt know he was un armed he could have pulled out a gun and killed him, if he tazed him he could shot the cop. By your logic armed robbers and mass shooters would be running free here. shouldn't have stole or resisted arrest brought it on himself do you have no empathy? Stealing = jail, not being followed then killed killing other people because they kill people? Lol sorry didn't know it was still the 1900s yeah they faked the video LOL racist denial I don't care if MIKEBROWN was rumning down the street with a stolen TV P.O. had no right to execute him! oh pleaseüò¥ even going extreme length to hire an actor that looks like Michael brown! Not saying murder was justified, it's not did you see the video?do you think the police faked the video? are you saying this ISNT Michael brown??please I agree did I say it was fake u , are u stupid or dumb? I said why show it now... üòí that being said, even if he committed the most awful crime on planet earth, he DID surrender. No reason to be shot. thankyou exactly my point no need to thank im with u that stealing a 80cnt cigar shouldnt trump a kid who had a future. We all do stupid shit what about the FBI this is just the beginning of the information!!! no offense 2 u sir but unless he was reaching 4 a gun then there was no reason for this to happen do they count as part of the stupid LEO because their part of this investigation too. Video doesn't lie no offense taken sir and normally I would agree with you but their is more to this story. you missed the part where he reaches in and takes these cigars? Passes them to his friend and takes some him self.POS again he could have paid for them They wouldn't release video if it wasn't. Hat, shoes and clothes are distinctive. MICHAELBROWN He struggled with a cop and went for his gun - that's what got his a$$ killed the point of releasing the video was to slander mike brown an give him a ""dangerous black male"" aesthetic the officer who shot him didn't know that he was a suspect and that still doesn't justify him being shot HE WENT FOR HIS GUN - robbery or not. Don't fight a cop - that's what got him killed. here we have a male using a police description of what happened over 3 eyewitness accounts Ya an eyewitnesses are the most reliable. Videos dont lie - pictures don't lie. where did you see videos of brown going for the officers gun? fox news? WATCH THE VIDEO. He's not selling Girl Guide Cookies!! He steals from a store and struggles to leave. Videos don't lie and all the PRO-MICHAEL BROWN supporters need to back-peddle. So let's deflect back to Cops there's no proof that he struggled with the cop there's no proof he didn't.  Show me your proof of hands up being shot. there are eye witness accounts that he had his hands up there's no proof that he reached for the gun Eyewitnesses in this gongshow dont mean much. He was portrayed as a great kid. He's a thief and violent. so that means he should be shot? You're not going to win this argument lmao He attacked the cop!!!!! are you really that stupid?  Blacks supporting blacks saying whatever and a cop -  who's believing who? you guys made this a race issue,  to me white black or pink you go for a cop you're going down. you wanna win so bad you can't see the facts,  and with that you to will make stupid decisions. you're still saying he went for the gun when there's no proof that he did i'm done with this conversation photoshop lies Lol.  Ok keep stretching for this.  We will see the truth comes out. God bless you and your ignorance . Stay in your lane. Idiot WHY SHOW IT NOW???? because it is relevant you buffoon",1
Why was #Ferguson PD still looking for the suspect 7 hours after Michael Brown had been killed? http://t.co/xmMMBBN5nT," Wow RT: Why was FERGUSON PD still looking for the suspect 7 hours after Michael Brown had been killed? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS?!?!?!?!?!?! OMG, that is a HUGE question. FERGUSON. Ooo RT: Why was FERGUSON PD still looking for the suspect 7 hours after Michael Brown had been killed? what is source here? Because proper investigation requires more than jumping to conclusions. Brown resisted arrest for 'strong arm' robbery. OOP. open Lol RT: Because proper investigation requires more than jumping to conclusions. Brown resisted arrest for 'strong arm' robbery. Obvious failure to make the connection. Given the attention to the killing, less emphasis on robbery suspect. My guess. because they were bored? Small town, small crimes, big boredom Puppy Yeah, don't jump to conclusions before a trial. Anyway, let me tell you what *really* happened... hilarious. do you have the full report page with this on it could you post it if you haven't. That's why police investigated. They arrested prime suspect. He resisted, grabbed officer's gun. Paid price. proper investigation requires more than jumping to conclusions Police deal daily with arrestees. Most comply. Those who don't, risk their lives. Mobs jump to conclusions. Because proper investigation requires more than jumping to conclusions. Precisely. That's why police continued to investigate. Brown's resistance actions certainly suggested guilt. Since you already know what happened, why did the cop shoot him so many times, &amp; from so far away? Backwards hat? OH! RT: Why was FERGUSON PD still looking for the suspect 7 hours after Michael Brown had been killed WELP! "" Why was FERGUSON PD still looking for the suspect 7 hours after Michael Brown had been killed? can't believe there's a mob running your twitter account you aren't very smart. Follow your own advice and stop jumping to conclusions RT &amp; SHARE DARRENWILSON CAMERASONCOPSNOW!!!! FERGUSONSHOOTING KILLERCOPS MICHAELBROWN dudes running around shaming people for jumping to conclusions while doing the same thing. It's funny he definitely grabbed the cop's gun. there is evidence proving it. it's not hearsay evidence. yes, we must trust what the government says at all times. Unless of course it's Obama. Lol! haha wow he retweeted it, too. he believes the evidence exists. quite a conclusion to jump to. looks likeFERGUSON cops are gonna try &amp;use this Video to justify their actions, do we knw its Brown on tape? obama is a mob. a mob is a sandwich. Cops DIDN'T jump to conclusions, continued investigation. Mob jumped to conclusions. Mob rule FAIL you jumped to conclusions about him resisting arrest (which is not a capital crime anyway) You still haven't answered my question. I need u to because you have the answers: you are jumping to conclusions moron. Are you some dope that believes everything the govt tells you? here's evidence to the contrary Happening Live No Less. not jumping to conclusions but black people clearly hacked twitter to make up an excuse to riot well that could be. But are blacks that smart? perhaps the benghazi four did it and hillary clinton killed them to cover it up. uh, not jumping to conclusions or anything Mobs aren't based on color but on inciters who may be motivated by racism or another ""ism""... maybe they're upset that the police in their town have repeatedly used excessive force. maybe the ism they're motivated by is police racism. Congrats on your 250‚òÖ tweet! there you go using common sense and logic! üëç Anecdotal. No reason to believe it. Shots fired does not equal accurate shots. Perp went for gun, ran. how do you know he went for the gun? also i'm not sure you know what anecdotal means. Remember: story in defense of dead black kid = anecdotal. Story in defense of murderer cop = truth. like how they left him in the street 4 4hrs &amp; never called the EMs only 2 load him into a black SUV? I've chaired a fed board that weighed evidence. Know anecdotal. TWO cops say Brown went for gun. personal accounts are inherently anecdotal, unless you're talking about a large-scale study Anecdotal evidence non-fact-based, non-evidence-based. Inherently weighed by a court as less reliable. i'm aware of the definition of anecdotal. both the tweets and officer reports are anecdotal. is there any forensic evidence that he went for the gun? NO. But testimony of sworn police officer given greater weight in court of law than claims by a perp. you're arguing with an idiot RT: Why was FERGUSON PD still looking for the suspect 7 hours after Michael Brown had been killed? perp of what? what crime did he perpetrate? it's a crime scene, if he's dead he obviously doesn't need medical attention. he chaired a fed board about not jumping to conclusions, maury. please afford him some respect. you know that's one of the reasons they dq prospective jurors right? Not aware. Could be cop car video. But apparently we have two cops swearing to it. Why would they lie? Of course, the thing to remember throughout all of this: the same reason anyone else lies so now dead people at ""crime scenes"" dont get EMS? ITS STANDARD procedure. They never calldled it in *Called Anecotal: Resisting arrest, assaulting cop = 2 crimes. If also committed strong arm robbery, then that's three. anecdotal. Puppy and you know that he committed those crimes because...the police said so hmmm...dead guy at the end of my block last weekend didn't need EMS, he was dead. You clearly don't know legal definition of 'anecdotal'. I've had to weigh evidence. Difference matters HELLO ‚Äú: Why was FERGUSON PD still looking for the suspect 7 hours after Michael Brown had been killed? i don't believe your claim to have weighed anything. your evidence is anecdotal. Discription NO. We have solid evidence  resisted arrest &amp; assaulted police because shot running away from arrest. Good for your made up example. There's a difference between ""no need"" and STANDARD PROCEDURE. Sit. &amp; if you *are* telling the truth it's scary as shit that you're in any way involved w/application of laws That's your right. Urge you to examine statutes/cases for real understanding of anecdotal evidence. riiiiight...let me call the coroner and let him know that dude isn't dead that got shot thru the eyeüëç I weighed evidence as chair of board dealing with other legal matters, but same evidence rules. Lol wut - now *running away* is grounds for being shot got shot *more than 7 times. But again, it is STANDARD PROCEDURE.  Stop deflecting and derailing. my friend the sgt that was shot 11 times was immediately transported..why? because he was ALIVE...üëç so he assaulted the cops in the process of running away from them? officers are trained to keep shooting until the threat is eliminated, it's not a game.. good for your cracker friend. Still doesn't negate the fact that its still STANDARD PROCEDURE. unlike Hollywood, there are no 'warning shots' fired. yes keep shooting why the person is surrendering with their hands up. So much of a threat. Amirite? Unlike Hollywood, piece of shit savage crackers are hunting down people of color for sport. hahahaha. Way to go racist..Sgt MacNeil is African American ...YOUIDJIT I didnt know there was a such thing as reverse racism.  Is there a default button? I wasn't there, I'm no armchair quarterback. I prefer to see facts... dumb, no such thing as 'reverse racism'...please go back to school. facts frm a department who is known for being racist pieces of shit. Umm ok. duh and I dont have the systematic power to be a racist. Maybe prejudice. So you go back to school. Because no one matched the discription. But in all seriousness, why? Good share. Interesting that you describe black witness as ""perp"". Says a lot about your mindset. I really should log off, need tell all my friends I'm racist üòÇ ohhhh the, ""I cant be racist because I have black friends"" trope. Stop. lol...okey..thank gawd you are able to label me as racist..whew!! I never knew... and this coming from the scholar that has used 'cracker' IAMRUBBERYOUAREGLUE way to keep it classyüëç /m qt.cigars üëà states what was stolen.No mention of weapons used gun etc.So was such violent force needed for petty theft Police have already said there was only 1 cop there. Btw, anecdotal evidence &gt;&gt; bullshit. the etymology definition of that word means ""person who cracks the whip"". Its befitting. Foh. and fuck your respectability politics. do you kiss your mother with that mouth?She must be so proud. You've turned out to be quite the racistüëç K. At least my mother didn't raise a police brutality apologist. üòÇ oh stoppp...I'm running out of room on my new business cards..let's see, racist &amp; now thisüëç DISCRIPTION MT: Why was FERGUSON PD still looking for the suspect 7 hours after Michael Brown killed? wait..this brutality thing..is that because I like handcuffs and stuff...? üò±üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ well gosh, this is a phenomenal point. Why WOULD they lie? Also WHY did the Ferguson PD write a report that Brown was the robber and close the case? COVERUP lmao that's the dumbest question ever asked",1
Key point: Officer Wilson was not aware that #MikeBrown was a robbery suspect. It will be key in establishing his state of mind. #Ferguson," üëèüëèüëèüëè WeneedthatverDict So why did he stop him? MICHAELBROWN new that he had just committed a serious crime.  That is key in establishing MICHAELBROWNS state of mind. Then why did that officer have contact could go to Brown's state of mind though? He maybe thought that's why he was being stopped? not following why that's important? I'm wondering if that maybe contributed to the struggle starting? Of course we'll never know the answer for sure. from what I gather, he was walking down street, kneeled down with hands in air before being shot. No struggle. one video of a guy said he was eyewitness, said they fought in the car, a shot rang, he knelt and was then shot in the head. OK I misunderstood it. No struggle, but Brown was in the police car at one point. so wouldn't the police car be close to the body in the pics? Or he move the car? that's what I wonder, but this guy says Brown was in the car Lots of eye witness accounts right now, guess to your point earlier, probably won't ever know truth for sure. Yup, I watched that ... absolutely crazy shit wouldn't open. But I saw 2 witnesses that said different only thing I dispute is that the police were called, and were looking for him. But Wilson didnt know about that. he said cop passed him walking, put it in reverse, and then got out and shot him multiple times while kneeling... and I call BS on anything they say, and don't believe he was inv the car. How much sense does that even make? he said at first he shot into the car, Brown got out and knelt, then cop shot him 9 times. this is the witness that said that so y'all saying 2 different stories. Looking at same video? IDK maybe I'm having trouble understanding him Who shot into the car? I took it that the cop shot into his own car while trying to get out, causing Brown to kneel Greg, try opening in a browser... the cop shot out the car at Mr. Brown, then got out car and shot again I seen it yesterday. And talked to people who spoke to him yes, that's what I understood it sounded ot me like Brown was in the car, a shot, then he got out and knelt. Maybe I'm wrong --- try that link Greg ok I got it wrong cop shot while in car. Got out. Mr. Brown then went to knees, shot again ok yea but I see how I misunderstood Not favoriting because I like it, but because that's the account I understood to be true as well. That's some messed up shit man. Walking down street. Cop goes in reverse. Shoots on way out of car. Then murders kid did anyone mention anything the cop,WIlson, might have said as to why he shot him? I mean witnesses. Did anyone hear Wilson say anything? he's not speaking, and won't speak. Police department and lawyers made sure of that Yup, 5th amendment rights; didn't file paperwork either they said today He didn't even write incident report. Which was weird in itself. Everyone should be fired by writing the report, he'd be providing evidence against himself. Yup. Question is, which citizens have video evidence? OR better yet, will FBI have ability to pull up satellite cam? one thing I disagree with that guy in that video about is Brown didnt look like he did nothing. Grabbed clerk... by the shirt and shoved him, clerk was trying to stop him. But that doesnt justify death by any means. what satellite cam? You don't think the FBI can pull up satellite video of any corner of the globe they wanted to? they dont have satellite imagery of everywhere. Thats physically impossible. so is it 100% proven that that's him in the video? Guy in video looks 50 pounds heavier to me his friend in the video admitted he was in the store getting cigars, but disputes Brown was stealing them. Plus. 5 mins walking in sandals? That's a lot of room. Plus no cigars found on him. that's BS too imo It could just be ""smoke"" / lame attempt to shift focus from murder to robbery. yea Police chief admitted Wilson didnt know about the robbery. I know it can be done, but you may be right in that the cams would already need to be focused there. witness from the video admitted Brown was there. That much I didnt misunderstand lol if the feds could surveil the entire US and world, there would never be any fugitives. I walk in flip flops everyday, that looks like about 6 - 8 blocks or more, no way that's done in 5 minutes walking. no. The witness said he was at the corner store, not at the QT. Watch again... IDK what to tell ya, the guy says it clearly. Just says Brown wasnt stealing. Not true. Not everything some in open. They can see what they want, but they need to be focused on the location. Yeah, he was saying it was a different store... watch again. You heard wrong well either way it had nothing to do with the shooting, so it's irrelevant clearly says he was at Ferguson Market... where did the robbery happen? Quick Trip police report says clerk indicated the suspect left and walked TOWARDS quick trip. He left an illness call to take a robbery call in the area, according to the Police Chief. Wrong robbery, wrong robber? Just sayin in the report at 1 point it says a box, another point it says a few packs. (cont) but again, stealing cigars imo, arguing with a cop, etc. Hitting a cop, once hands went up, incident over police report has zip code of robbery as 63135. Only quik trips in the area are 63136 Ferguson Farmer's Market Is 63135 no I get that it just sounds like his friend in the video has bad info of where the robbery happened. Cop went looking for the... robbery suspect at the Quik Trip, but that isnt where it happened. Clerk said suspect left store and went that way. if out was him, and he was picked up. How much time would he have gotten? 0, first (cont) Interesting. IDK officers responding to the theft say they never found suspect until he was dead, identified him as Brown and his friend... was there also, seen in video, identified as Dorian Johnson. goes back to stealing cigars shouldn't equal being shot dead, especially since officer had no idea about that... of course not, we've reiterated that. But a Quik Trip was burned down because of this, hope it wasnt a franchise. insurance covers a building and the goods inside. even if it was a franchise... Or is qt different? didn't know it was burned down? I'm not OK with that at all... still not my main concern or focus. if you can get them to cover all the loss. They'll nickel and dime away. it's a bad situation in many ways. Other innocents affected. I will never put any physical property over human loss. Even a car wreck, I say, well at least you're alive. but that's me. If I'm wrong then I can live with that. me neither, just saying the situation is bad in many ways. hey is Pierre OK? Wasn't at practice today. Me mentioned a knee injury, not sure how serious he'll be fine Thanks, Greg. THIS LADY SAYS IN THE VIDEO THE POLICE TOOK DOWN SECURITY CAMERAS WHERE MIKE BROWN WAS SHOT so you do admit an unarmed kid was shot right? And fled from where? and who's account was that? The officer's? Bc there's no dash cam video for some strange reason if the guy got shot and fled, where did the dead body come from? and as we've seen already. This police force is very (cont) furthermore, if he was shot twice while fleeing, in flip flops by the way. When he (cont) the witness accounts I've read all say the same thing. Only different one is the cops dash cams still have audio, do they not? Everyone in court I've seen has how many bullets did Mike Brown take - like 6 or 7? No pictures of an ambulance on the scene either so I instead of chasing someone for a Jay walking citation (cont) just have a judge Dred society? what's justice? He's dead. There is no justice... And can't be any justice... it takes 7 days to release a coroner's report... Nowhere in (cont) I believe the witness accounts heard 7+ ... 7 bullets needed for a kneeling unarmed 18 yr old? you have not been following the news lately. Police do go around shooting kids for no reason and I'm happy for you that you haven't been exposed to this during your lifetime That's not true... + the cop had no idea he was ""involved"" in a cigar robbery + none on him and that statement really just hurt my heart, and I am (cont) Well, that's the problem... This PD was already under federal investigation for shit like this. It does happen ... happened here in HI 3 years ago on street, cop just got off this week, nothing. Yep, before this happened, already under fed investigation for racial profiling / brutality etc. every single witness account is exact same. Only different 1 is the cop who didn't even write the incident report of his version of accounts 5th amendment, but right, that's why there's NO legal statement / account about anything... I'm not sure 5th applies to police reports. pretty sure they are required to write incident report especially if he did nothing wrong... Why wouldn't he write it and give his story while fresh based on history over last 5 year's, and that area. He gets (cont) I believe, in cases like this, they are told to not write or say anything that might incriminate... wait for lawyers to help write verbiage ... but that's just what I recall, could be wrong Makes Sense ... 5th Amendment. He has the right to not provide evidence against himself. from what I understand the FBI has taken over Given the circumstances, it's a good thing -- unless you're a State Rights ""they can handle it"", guy Which, given the circumstances, I chuckle at those individuals -- bc it's clear they can't handle it wouldn't be so bad if they weren't already under federal interest cases on the other hand, the FBI has a long history of being used as a political tool. Pick your poison.",1
#Ferguson Police Chief says #MikeBrown was stopped because he was walking in road NOT because he was suspected of stealing cigars.," they need to get the story straight. either way he didnt deserve what happened to him. But hey! Here's a bunch of information on an alleged robbery. Oh, no reason. FERGUSON MIKEBROWN misdirection. These guys are magicians. The American people must take the country back from the police employed to PROTECT and SERVE them (allegedly). That is what Al Jazeera America just reported too. So why did Wilson shoot Mike Brown? Proof of the slavery of USA No right, to walk on the very thing, designed for TRAVEL ;) there is no reason to justify. Perhaps for tha fact they've been gettin away w/ stuff all tha time &amp; can get away wit this. It's extremely sad so many loose ends and unanswered questions. Does not engender trust in alleged facts. So he was shot for jaywalking? u can tell they were gon tryn concoct a story to get themselves off. Wait 6 days to release cop name then come out saying he was alleged ""strong arm robbery"" suspect. They must think we're stupid yes, the delay and the piecemeal trickle (of unrelated events, even) concerns me it looks real bad. And they wonder ppl (mainly black) have such a high level of distrust in em the lie wasn't for you they gave the people who believe we ALL steal what they wanted to hear. shoplifting doesn't give any cop the right to play judge, jury, &amp; executioner I ques why some1 who worked as hard as Brown did 2 get 2 college would jeopardize that w/robbery exactly. None of it makes sense &amp; NOTHING they can justify tha outcome AGREED!! But we must recognize the tactics of the opposition to counter them correctly. Lol alleged. instead of arming cops with military gear, let's get cams ON every cop uniform 1st(not just dash cams) While you're doing that, why not acknowledge that it's not ok to rob stores. This is the real issue Irish. Thank you. it only makes sense. They don't like tha idea of em being caught abusing authority if that's him. Police chief already said he wasn't stopped cuz of that. Cop didn't know when our son started driving, we put cams in our car cuz cops here harrass teens What do you mean 'if'? There's pictures and his friend admitted it. which again goes to a cop abusing his authority. U don't shoot anybody w/ hands up Why does everyone just dismiss it like it's no big deal to rob a store? I agree but you have no clue that they were. Only witness is his robbing buddy. police chief has said officer did not know of robbery. Immaterial 2 shooting theft &amp; robbery are two DIFFERENT things. No, it's not. It shows this thug's state of mind. You're right but assaulting someone while stealing is ROBBERY and robbery STILL doesn't justify shooting an unarmed person w/ their hands up I'm not saying he deserved anything but you can just dismiss him robbing a store. because it is not relevant to ques of WHY cop shot&amp;killed Brown I have legal background. It is immaterial to the shooting. It's different now bc he's not just some innocent teen like he has been portrayed. who cares about your background? I have common sense. He was a thug. several witnesses to shooting say he had hands up as someone with a legal background, that's poppycock you cannot enter into facts of case a fact you didnt know at the time has no bearing in a court of law. he wqs not portrayed as innocent. Parents pointed out his earlier probs if you had common sense you'd loosen the grip on your determined racism and look at the bigger pic Ok I'm not saying don't throw the cop in jail. I'm saying look at this  piece of shit: as 2 why he was shot dead,arms up,unarmed...yes I can dismiss it when cop unaware of theft and fuck your race baiting. I treat everyone as equals. if I beat my spouse&amp; no 1 knew, then got shot by cop while walking in street,is justified? I bet you can buddy. But I'm the racist. What if this was your shop? no, but I would give you zero sympathy. I've never said it was justified. unless u can say a plausible as to why tha cop shot a teen dead w/ arms up, there's you can't bring someone into understanding that doesn't want to understand nothing else to talk about I said nothing about racism never defended the cop. It's possible for the cops and mike brown to be pieces of shit. so for you, the real issue is morality of persons involved, &amp; not the law? but he was a thug.... ok. The issue is police brutality. The issue is militarization of our police. Race certainly comes into play. Agreed there. K ‚Äú: FERGUSON Police Chief says Brown was stopped bcus he was walking in road NOT because he was suspected of stealing cigars. Congrats on your 250‚òÖ tweet! contradicts what was said in televised presser where indicated cop was not aware of robbery when stopped Brown ever changing stories: i completely understand your logic man, you don't gotta convince me. Kid didn't deserve to die but he was not innocent I don't remember any1 saying he was; even his parents pointed out his past troubles in interviews. yeah i mean its the fact the kid supposedly had his hands up and was still shot, FROM THE CAR, then taken away in a TAHOE Indeed. smells of a bad coverup job exactly, there was absolutely wrong doing and we are all smart enough to see its NOT RIGHT that's what's making ppl more mad. They didn't follow ANY protocol in this case A video of him robbing a store and his friend admitting it Is all fake? Here's the other side. they couldn't eem transport his body in an ambulance. They put it in a SUV I agree that was fucked up. Could the SUV have been a coroners' vehicle? Couldn't tell from picture. as far as I know, it was unmarked. Thought it was procedure to have an ambulance Def should have tried to save him or at least taken him in an ambulance. yea. Not sure how u shoot somebody surrendering 8x. two days later, another cop shot a unarmed dude in LA. Shit is gettin outta hand we've had our share in S.FL. Tasered a kid to death a yr ago in Miami If you ask me, it's less aggression &amp; more bad training &amp; trigger-happy fear.",1
#ferguson police engaged in character assassination to cover up actual assassination. you. simply. don't. shoot. unarmed. teenagers. EVER.," you don't shoot unarmed PEOPLE ever. FIXEDTHATFORYOU :) If they're physically overpowering you and a reasonable person would conclude your life is in danger, you probably should unarmed != not dangerous. An unarmed Chuck Liddell will still beat you to death. Even if they grab for your gun? If YOU have a gun, someone runs FROM you, DROPPED TO THEIR KNEES W/ARMS RAISED...HOW IS *YOUR* LIFE ENDANGERED?!? Categorically for what you described you're correct. But that's not what happened with Brown, there was a struggle Also, I said ""reasonable person,"" which is a standard term SCOTUS often defaults to. So, in the case you mentioned, a reasonable person would NOT conclude their life was in danger :) There was no struggle. The armed officer was yards away from someone who was on his knees with his arms raised. That depends on whose account you believe. I'd take the account of an office over that of a thief, but hey *thief's friend, I mean That said, all of this is hypothetical since the FERGUSON PD still hasn't told us exactly how struggle started And I wouldn't take the word of a White, armed, police officer whi shot an unarmed, surrendering, person. Well now you're prejudging based on race, which puts you in the same boat as the one you claim he's in Privilege has its perks. It allows you to automatically take the word of the police, regardless of the situation. Me prejudging on race is waaaaaay different than you prejudging on race. That's just the way it is. Sad, but true. Well if I'm being robbed who do I call: residents, or 911? Who is ""you?"" I'm black. Or did you miss that part? And racism is racism. Period. You weren't there you have no idea what happened. You talk about taking an officer's word over his ""friend"" ignoring that there are MULTIPLE eyewitness Of course you call the cops...and, since you're Black, I know you  pray they do right by you like they should. accounts that contradict the story you choose to believe. Are you implying that all residents of that yea but i knw being a black male , hw ive been treated in the past by police whn i hadnt done nuthin either. sooo yeah there are multiple eyewitness accounts of a confrontation too, from what I read neighborhood are predisposed to being untrustworthy, criminal sympathizers? My house was robbed multiple times growing up. I know who we turned to. And it wasn't our neighbors. You said that, I didn't. where did you hear these accounts to the contrary? Because every major new outlet I've seen reinforces the fact, by way of eyewitnesses, that he was a number of feet away with hands in a surrender position when the bullets were discharged. And I didn't say anything, I was asking if that's what YOU were implying. No, I wasn't implying that. So, you haven't had a negative experience with police...yet. May the odds be ever in your favour, sir.  ; ) I've had 1 in South Dakota where I was pulled over for ""speeding"" coming from my hotel, but I got a warning Aside from that, no one's harassed me per se. But I know my experience isn't everyone's That's not the same as not being automatically trusting of police. It's a federal case &amp; civil rights investigation now, so we'll find out what's what. I really, really hope so. In this and other cases across the nation. Thanks for the discussion!! : ) NP! Even Chuck Liddell can't harm you while running away or at a distance with his hands up. FERGUSON True! Racism and fear pulled the trigger. Ever. Had. ur ass kicked by 300 lb Teenager? Last time I checked 19 is an adult.and yes you can shoot an unarmed adult IF they try to take your gun. that's the law.sorry It's not... unfortunately that never happened. No evidence of that. On their knees? hands raised? really? Really? what about a rape victim being assaulted by an unarmed man?That may change your opinion.Never say ever So tell your body guards when a violent man runs full steam at you next time! LEARNTHEFACTS before you unload on TWITTER. so you'd risk missing the offender and shooting the rape victim instead? Way to go, glad you thought THAT through. You're blocked. I'm talking about the victim protecting herself. You block everyone who has a diff opinion? That's mature. And if someone breaks into your home while you sleep you can't shoot until you know he's armed? You actually can under the law",1
"Store owner told @FOX2now Monday that there was a theft, but said it was not MichaelBrown; said it was someone else #Ferguson"," no doubt scared for his life. It's obviously mike brown in the video Somebody else probably did commit theft.  Brown committed Robbery. Obviously? So he took off his socks in the 5m between the video and getting shot? dude even his parents acknowledge it's him. Any chance that's being said for fear of retribution? Is that the video also? And the store owner and the pictures say it wasn't. Why does someone who didn't see it matter? actually I did use the word robbery he seemed frightened possibly. He seemed frightened even though his friend and witness to the shooting has admitted to the cigarillo theft? Your post states theft.  What am I missing? or maybe the police scared him into saying it was michael brown in the first place? Dorian Johnson just confirmed it was them. What now? BLACKDENIAL or is that impossible because the police would never be capable of unscrupulous behavior? I def did not say that. And even if it was MIKESMITH I certainly don't think he deserved to die for it. you just repeated what you said in the last tweet, p sure my reply doesn't change im not saying you did, but that is what has been implied the entire course of this investigation that's why the police's testimony has been considered law despite it contrasting what EYEWITNESSES said but you have two pictures of people with different clothes, and an eyewitness who says it wasn't him and the last time i checked the eyewitness testimony overrides the testimony of the defident's friends but reasonable doubt? Innocent until proven guilt? Nah, fuck it, let's execute him Good job getting (a guy who looks a bit like a) petty thief off the street (four hours after shooting him) Not by this kid. you seem to be the only one and that is a testament to your character miss. There are lots of us out there. Promise. Brown's family attorney said in an interview today that the person in the video ""probably is Brown"" we all need to unite then. solidarity is key in the face of adversity and prejudice. Truer Words have never ghosts. it's obviously the same people and there's a confession when I spoke to store owner, I said ""robbery"", tweeted ""theft"" in error Hey everybody, robbed a store. Can they shoot you down? Can I say that after they shoot you down? whose mike smith ? Thank you for clarifying.  You definitely didn't have to reply to me.  Have a great day and thanks for the reports I'm not arguing that he deserved to be shot. And also obliterating your attempt to deny that he was the person that robbed the store Then what are you arguing? So he took off his socks but did nothing else to change his appearance? Obliterated, lol snitches get stitches in the hood. Store owner knows. BLACKDENIAL CHANGEYOURCULTURE dude give it up. It's him. Confirmed. looooool. ""snitches get stiches in the hood"" (noracist bro) You get the last word here, I can't argue with everyone forever. Peace. Very embarrassing! Of course I meant MIKEBROWN. Ugh But Dorian Johnson already admitted they were in store and stole This is getting stranger by the minute. Will we ever get to the truth? Where's  With this breaking news? Police Chief making press conference. SMOKESCREEN4MURDER FERGUSON Y'all --&gt; "" Store owner told Monday that there was a theft, but said it was not MichaelBrown said it was someone else"" "" Store owner told Monday that there was a theft, but said it was not MichaelBrown; said it was someone else"" I could tell it wasn't him when I saw the video. why did the store owner say it wasn't him and the friend admitted it was? Have the gotten an explanation now in now in Why !!Jeez !! think he was too scare to tell who it really was? How many 6'5"" 300  men in Ferguson ?",1
"Last position of Germanwings flight #4U9525 at 09:40 UTC
http://t.co/FHoX6q0GHt http://t.co/72pxGKolRM"," D-AIPX dropped considerable altitude in the 20 mins prior to losing signal. 6800 ft is low for the Alps, yes? ‚Äî Last position of Germanwings flight 4U9525 Apparently a slow falling? Yes, is now looking at the replay and you can indeed see him falling a lot in advance: Descending to 6800ft and suddenly gone....Isn't this the serial that suffered from 'cracked windows'? Last position of the A320 via 4U9525 at 09:40 UTC Geeeez. Look at that Vertical Speed!:( ‚Äú: Last position of Germanwings flight 4U9525 at 09:40 UTC SPM:: Last position of Germanwings flight 4U9525 at 09:40 UTC Is the red dotted line the route it should've taken? i know! Terrible :( More likely that at this altitude the plane hit a mountain which go up to 10000 feet and more and this area. ‚Äú: Last position of Germanwings flight 4U9525 at 09:40 UTC carked it in the mountains. Hairy. :( ‚Äú: Last position of Germanwings flight 4U9525 at 09:40 UTC would the plane won halfway? What was the Squawk? Pilot has binned it up the side of a mountain because he's ISIS. Check, but there must a reason wich created an emergency. I've seen several A320 with cracked windshields in the past vertical speed 4000'/min ?? totall madness on board? very strange Could be a glitch, but look at the path colour. Whatever happened it started long before.. was about to say that... 6,800 feet above Alps.. looks like it was having issues long before it lost signal. look at its decent rate at the top... It's final steps line 30 is interesting - 14,144 ?? but no altitude change‚Ä¶ that is very weird why would it go at 10,000 in the Alps?? The last 10 minutes. I think 5K feet is the tip of the alps already? I worked it out at a minimum of 3100ft/min. I think an A320's maximum decent rate is 1800ft/min. Don`t know. They said decent rate would be like a normal decetn for landing. my Point of view: don`t think so. pretty fast decend Very strange this change of the route.Would it be the instrument failure? Seriously? This was an experienced pilot who also lost his life! you really have no shame! -_- obviously not that experienced. his next flight is up to heaven. 6800ft are also the surrd'g mountains. So, the radar contact interrupted at this height. The Crash site is lower. How do you know? It may have been that the windscreen craccked causign hypoxia. (1/2) The captain had 10 yrs 6000 hours with Germanwings &amp; Lufthansa, which is extremely experienced 2/2 1800ft/min is the minimum unpowered rate (ie optimal glide path with engines off). Grow up, mate. Maybe you should. At leaat I have respect for the victims... Mate. You're a plane spotter. Have you ever kissed a girl? you clearly don't. Disgusting. Yeah Im an Aviation Enthusiast &amp;have flying hours myself. And no I havent kissed a girl, I've kissed a guy tho... How do I not? I'm not the one who's accusing him of shoving his jet in the mountain... IS THAT GAYCODE? But the FACTS are that he did shove it into a mountain. CASE CLOSED! Wha ??? The pilots could have been unconscious from hypoxia. Airbus jets do have a tendency to have windscreens crack. Tell me more whilst I put this carrier bag over my head. i think you're right. Told you it was a shithouse job. hahahaha! ""FACTS""? Show me! I got a bad bout of hypoxia once but it didnt makeme crash a plane into a mountain that's a crash in a mountain. please read the report from the voice recorder before digging yourself into a grave everyone knows it was an inside job. The report says the co pilot was an ""ISIS sympathiser and shithouse"". My God! those exact words. I read the report Where was the pilot? How come he didn't use the crash axe and go all Ken Bigley on the co-pilot? thought after 9/11 crash axes werent allowed anymore You thought. And that is your problem. the Germans will blame us. Putin will order them over the channel ffs no that is your problem. My problem is shithousery existing. theiahhahahaha",1
"Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet. http://t.co/MthXQ232Hn"," But no emergency call made? Or emergency squawk? RT A320 4U9525 initially climbed to 38k ft before starting to descend and lost signal at 6.8k ft Sounds like a decent of 2900fpm Any ATC available? Strange..... isn‚Äôt 38,000ft unusually high? Sent Mayday through radio. I suppose he had other things to do than adjust the Squawk yes and no depends on other traffic, turbulence... they were 25 mins late so going higher = going quicker Only takes a second to set the squawk code, What's the use when you're crashing? yes but every second not spent trying to save everyone..... although steep descent ! It looks like a decompression. If not, someone crashed it deliberately. if a decomp why would they not be diverting away from mountains to nearest apt? if deliberate then would expect steeper descent &amp; increased speed. Exact! Instead of headingright into the mountains The plan would be to level out. I'd be going with hi-jacking. The mountains aren't real high there. too early to say but lack of divert suggests something bad happened. In case of a deliberate crash it would have descended faster, no? Not neccesarily. It turns out there was no distress call made. I'm almost certain this was a hi-jacking now. Unless they became rapidly unconcious It looks like someone was flying it manually, all the way into the ground. Anyway. Have to wait and see now. For sure not, it was following exactly the same flight path as day before No, somebody had just initiated the descent, and might have been unconcious or dead just after that. If someone set the autopilot to fly it into the ground, the descent rate would have been constant. which seems to be the case.Constant descent, wind variations set aside.. Yep, it's follow exactly the route going down, that seems to suggest unconscious pilots. What I'm saying is, I believe it was deliberately crashed. Being controlled all the way into the ground They're saying what I said, the crash was a deliberate act. Controlled flight all the way down. Or autopilot. But sure deliberately set. I don't think the autopilot was engaged. They're now saying the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane. That's what they say. The data from the transponder made it obvious. Would be good to get the data from the Flight Data Recorder though. The transponder did not say anything. No sqwak 7700. It was obvious it was being manually controlled by the changes in descent rate. Also no distress call. I thought it was hi-jacked and being flown by then. If it's true that the co-pilot did crash it deliberately, the whole industry needs a shake-up. It only takes a moment to enter 7700 into the transponder. I've worked on these systems before. Autopilot was manually changed from 38,000 to 100 ft at 09:30:55 (Flightradar24 says) The autopilot wasn't set to 100 feet. It was flown manually. FlightRadar24 has made that up. Have you operated a flight mqnagement computer before? I used to test them. What FlightRadar24 is ahowing is changes made the flight profile. That doesn't indicate that the autopilot was set to 100 feet. I've worked on these systems, tested them and have operated them in sumulators. Also on actual flights when I've been in the flight deck. Look at the time on each line. The altitudes are requested not achieved. But that's the FMC, doesn't mean autopilot was engaged. what's the use of changing FMC if autopilot not engaged? It changes the flight profile and cuts out the warnings and some of the protection.",1
"A gunman is killed after shooting at war memorial and Canadian parliament in Ottawa, media reports say http://t.co/sj9jOKOw2X"," üôèA gunman is killed after shooting at war memorial and Canadian parliament in Ottawa, media reports say It's not Muslims that are doing this but terrorists. Please remember this. More hate more recruits. am i right in thinking canada has 'imported' more followers of islam than any other major country ? Shame. what complete rubbish. This is the 'religion of peace' at work yet again. learn how to spell immigrants before making stupid comments like that!! It is true that Canada is more tolerant to other cultures, however, stuff like this is a rarity compared to the US We don't see a lot of fanatics trying to shoot up our Parliament Buildings as they do here in DC. A sad day for your gorgeous country but it needs to wake up to the major problems we're gonna get from islam These 'fanatics! are doing what the quran tells them to do to the non believer. We need to wake up quickly. better get used to this because it'll be happening worldwide I don't disagree. But its the same down here in the US, with the Christian Fanatics and the nonexistant gun laws There are always going to be fanatics and the lunatics that carry out the worst possible scenarios. We can't blame an entire religion for a group of people that are insane.Not all Muslims are evil. Religion as a whole has a lot to answer for if you ask me. I'm so glad i wasn't brainwashed as a child Nor are all Christians the Westbro Baptists either.People choose to interpret religious teachings in their own way I don't believe a word of it. Religion is legalised brainwashing. Islam is just incompatable in the west Not all religion is bad. Belief is a personal thing. However you see it Its the fanatics that make it look bad. go there or any other country and you'll find peaceful moderate Muslims as well! Way more of them! We need to stop brainwashing children and let them come to their own conclusion on the matter of religion Which is why open dialog is important. That is what I have with my children. look I'm not saying Islamism or any radical ideology of any religion is right but saying every Muslim is bad ain't either. Islamophobia is just as bad as radical Islamism and doesn't help in solving this Sounds like they have a fab mum. Hahaha .. i trry! Keep em safe sweety. From what i here DC is quite a dangerous city in places as are many US cities. no it's not!! It's pointless having this discussion really, what you're doing is being a fascist dick and I'm not having none of it! Islam is a religion just like any other and there will always be people who Many Thanks! don't understand what it is really about and they'll  abuse it and that's it! Stop spreading islamophobia are you fucking kidding me Russia Ukraine? Any Muslim motivation you can see there? No, point invalid. Good bye Again terrorists. Not Muslims. Muslims don't shoot at people, terrorists do. Have a flick through some of the more aggresive bits of the quran Niall. Their incompatable how am I happy, are you even listening to what I'm saying!! I am completely against Islamism and I'm against any form of terrorism as well as it's not confirmed that this was an Islamist attack Nduna_lux, You Sound Like Hitler. could have been anyone really I just think there are millions of Muslims. You can't label them all. But that's my opinion. What they are doing is completely against the Koran in any case. not the made up one. Again there are different versions. You should see the iranian one. Point is these guys are radicalised. different from the law abiding Muslims. I just think it's important to differentiate. It's official, you're an idiot. Education is a wonderful thing. In humanity. No religion preaches hate, and you ought to know that but you prefer to be ignorant. read exodus 22:20. Then shut up There are lunatics in every culture, every ethnicity. There are also innocent people in every culture as well. Your tweets are offensive to those who are true to their faith, &amp; true to the peacefulness of society, as all are These people are insane. U buy the fact that they are religion based, they are not. No religous person murders. Ppl  that believe like u are the reason I will hide with my innocent wife in our apartment in fear of retaliation how am I an extremist please? I'm not even a religious person? Hey George, George Bush, is that you? You already don't. I was going to let her know the shooter was a Canadian drug addict but it looks like she deleted her account.. , Christian fanatics did not beheading child. No order in Bible to fight infidel and force other to submit. No Christan Fanatics don't behead,they do bomb women's health clinics and spread racism in the name of Christ , And you know that's not Christian teaching, that's politic issue. Islam terrorist issue is about pure teaching of Islam. Interesting. But no. Most of the Christian Fanatics use Christ as their excuse to spread Racism and Hate. , The reason they kill because other has diff religion. Christian fanatic may blow cause of revenge and hatred, not of relig Gay Marriage?Goes against the bible. Abortion? Goes against the Bible. Do you live here in the US? To see the lvl of hatred spewed all in the name of religion?Murders or bombing of clinics? , yes,it against bible&amp; it does not make they kill and behead people, right? Because you think someone goes against the bible? Muslim Fanatics just have a different way of getting their point across. It makes them kill. Murder is murder. Whether or not you take a person's head off in the process. Fanatical Christians justify killing someone the same way a Fanatical Muslim does. It goes against their religion. oh well some people don't deserve to know the truth , not true, no teaching to kill infidel in Christian.The act of ISIS told by their quran. Bombing an Abortion clinic in the Jesus and the Almighty God isn't the same?Both have a book of teachings. , when he bombing it, its not led by Jesus'teaching for sure, but ISIS is led by literal teaching of Qur'an. I get what your are saying, however, both cases religion is the root of the issue, the issue being murder. , You take higher level view, which not objectively explained the real root cause.Actually that's total diff case. My point is all organized religions have their own brand of Fanatics. Murder in the name of religion is never good.",1
CTV News has confirmed the name Canadian authorities provided to U.S. authorities is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau. #OttawaShooting," Anyone who is suspected of ties with ISIS should be deported. Stop the political correctness!! Enough is enough!! How can you deport them when they ARE  canadian??? Deport them where? Daryl, Did they get him ? He was killed at the Parliament. Yes he was shot dead... Good ! Do they know if he acted alone ? Not sure ..... Still Fluid Situation I guess at this point that makes sense. Thank you for the info, I appreciate it. Thank you for the info ! I think you are implying that this person is of Arabic background.. That's kinda prejudice don't u think? Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's name is Ukranian-French, not middle-eastern. Bibeau is a French surname. Jonathan, that photo is fake, put up be trolls and fearmongers. NO photo has been released by police yet. Get a clue! CBS &amp; Dailymail conf his name. They're not Canadians who were born here. They do not deserve to be Canadian. Back where they/their family came from. Nope, not prejudiced just a fact. Sorry if that FACT bothers you!! Actually, you are wrong. They ARE born here. And they ARE bred here. So they ARE canadian just like you and me! Nope. They don't deserve that right. I can't believe you stand behind these people. Are you for real??  Very sad!! nope doesn't bother me any. Just wanted to confirm your ignorance, and I did. Thanks! + even if they were not born here, they hold a cdn citizenship so they're canadian. There's not 2 class of citizens. Did that soldier deserve to die!!?? Whose rights are you for?? Hope your friends and family know where you stand. Glad you think my loyalty to my country and peaceful citizens is ignorance. You're a loser!! who cares what they hold. They don't deserve to hold it and should be stripped of it. WOW I don't stand behind them, but i don't believe in 2 types of citizens. if you are cdn you are cdn. you will face they canadian law like any citizen if you commit a crime period Sorry. Not if you're a terrorist!!! Unbelievable!!! That's a Joke !!!! I disagree on this. So when You commit a crime, should i strip you of your citizenship? You are so ridiculous. Just listen to yourself!! he was a Canadian citizen dumbshit. What's your definition of being Canadian??? Of course that soldier did not deserve to die. They same way someone killed in a robbery does not deserve to die. Not being a terrorist you dumb fuck!!! Glad you stand behind these people!! What about the soldier that died? Is that a joke? Not the same thing at all. You're quite ignorant!!! Me being ridiculous is your opinion. I just don't agree with your opinion. A candian is Canadian not matter what. And that's your bleeding heart opinion. Good bye!!! wow u seriously need to learn to read and stop jumping topics. I grieve for the fallen solider and his family, but your poor.. Sure, of course i'm ignorant. The fact is there're laws, u commit a crime, u are punished. not striped of ur ctzship choice of words like ""deport them"" is the issue here. The gunman was a Canadian, how do you deport someone who is from here?? city judging from his responses, i think he has a hard time comprehending what he reads. Forgive him. oh I get it your definition of being Canadian is one that doesn't include people of mid-east descent THATSPREJUDICE I seriously don't get that shortcut.  I say he can't deport them and all of a sudden I'm a behind criminals... I sincerely hope that is NOT  his definition of being Canadian. something tells me he's an idiot and that something are his tweets lol First of all you idiot I'm a female. Second maybe you will read yours and ask yourself how Canadian you really are My definition of being Canadian is to love this country and it's citizens. Very sad yours is NOT!! Robbing a bank and being a terrorist are two totally separate things. You're an ignorant asshole. I have no problem with comprehension!! lol who taught you English in school?? They need to be fired. One of the dumbest ppl I've seen on twitter hahaha oh and you definitely aren't a ""good dude"". I think you are slightly demented, just slightly. You hop topics faster than you hop dicks. So have a bad day and FUCK YOU Killing someone no matter ur intentions behind the killing is the same to me.  U commit a crime, u face the law. You are not stripped of your citizenship in either cases. Sorry just saw thisWhat u just defined is being patriotic. Which is different from citizenship (at least to me) To be clear I love my Country &amp; the people who fight for itI'll not condone prejudice nor the notion of 2nd grade citizens",1

OTTOWASHOOTING RT: BREAKING: Canadian official identifies dead Ottawa gunman as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau. he is. He converted.... Calling a spade a spade. Blame ISIS. remember northern irland? stop the madness.. and read his history Ottawashooting Blame Ur Government no, he converted. The attack a few days before came from a radicalized convert too. RT: BREAKING: Canadian official identifies dead Ottawa gunman as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau. nop its pure lie for what? I'm identifying that guy as an asshole. but what if he really is? Can't trust religion, especially that one The Irish didn't murder themselves as well as the ""enemy"". He was apparently ALGERIAN religion has nothing to do here.. stop blaming muslims blame the corrupted ISIS who were founded by BY the USA and its allies for the stereotypes made towards Muslim people. I was saying that it's sad, but true. Oh please... What about all the gunman in US, all those kids they weren't Muslim! It's not about religion they're crazy I just don't believe everything I hear. Gotta know what to pick and choose. I respect people of the Muslim religion. Just asking a question... lol i wish everyone was thinking like u I'm not Muslims but I have many friends who are and they are great people and against that BS. Gunman are crazy whatever while you are correct on the founding factor.   Something about that religion gets people to behave violently. Can't deny that Good! No more peaceful than any other religion and I do blame our govt somewhat. their religion. Btw why We care about his religion (he converted) the man is a criminal end if the story. We should talk more about the victims. May they rest in peace you are wrong, ISIS are not Muslims.. but i also blame ur  government for invading other countries in the name of peace making Those Amish have it figured out! and we can make the world peaceful if we are together.. we don't blame moslm, moslm should blame moslm. Don't hide your face n said it's not moslm when it's clearly moslm Apparently hum. We don't really yet but he converted while Algerians are already Muslims so don't believe everything you read They're not affected by media/govt corruption but have to deal with their own internal problems. you also can't blame people for being terrified. People should however stand together and kill these guys blame the government n not blaming the shooter who is moslem? A typical moslemüòÅ its like with anything else. Religion can be used for good but also for bad. It just takes one person Btw why We care about his religion or his background.He's canadian. Btw the gunmen is US are not Muslims it's not about religion no love i disagree with u on that.. absalutly ISIS have no place in our society.. Love in Blame Both thank you!! That's exactly what it is. All muslims that believe in koran and sharia are terrorists. no they don't. I mentioned his religion not with a single word, so what are talking about...? whatever.. i believe in both and am not terorist.. glad we can agree. Would be nice if nations and religions could truly practice tolerance and fight back. God bless. absalutly i agree with you.. u seems blaming government more than your moslem brother. I'm not blaming u. Its ukhuwah but pls dont happy to much what about boko haram? Not yet anyway.  Once you enforce sharia on any woman in your family, you are a terrorist. you know nothing about islam.. i will appriciate if u shut ur mouth.. what about them? If I'm not mistaken his action is a reaction. SO YOU APPROVE? Go f yourself.  What about genital mutilation? Stoning for adultery? Honor killing?  Seems you dont know. were they also founded by the US? Of course not silly. That's like you approving ur local child molester feeling on a boy. Canada has no business in Iraq. Last i check Iraq's Prime Minister asked them to be there. Yup, really? yup as their oil was sold to the USA and they never gt the benefits IS has no business in IRAQ Well everyone, here we have another lying muslim. I Balme Media Too hello boko haram is in Northern Nigeria, they DON'T have oil. The oil is in the South, Niger Delta Just because there's oil there doesn't mean its your business Let them fight their own fight. What do u care Mr Texas? call it south or north but the oil belongs to all nigerians not only south.. as nigeria is one country.. western media or radical moslem media n PR? Be honest both for example in 2011 when Anders Behring Breivik who was a xtian killed 77 people the media called him mad man instead of calling  terorist or is it only muslims are terorist? and bcos of oil they kill children in their beds, kidnap women and girls, blow people up every other day? What do you call bin laden, Al Baghdadi, Abubakar Shekau, Al Zahawiri etc? boko haram is not about oil, I live in Southern Nigeria, so I can tell you boko haram is an Islamic terrorist group period i dont support that... that is against humanity... terorists who are devils and destroyers Lol u are entitiled tou your opinion but that is not my opinion. are they moslem? youcan not treat the symptoms unless u treat the causes of terorism nop .. are they jew? and Dont Know You Tell Me they are mujahid aren't they? they terror non moslem don't they? Mujahids dont kill Innocent kids and mothers u think it's bcos of oil that they are forcing Christians in the North to convert to islam or be killed? Eh? that is not islamic... do you know how many muslims they kill daily? yes treat the cause, which is that radical muslims should stop teaching their children to hate they kill non believers who happen to be a moslem So Mujahid IF Kills Innocent Non Muslim though? absalutly.. the boko haram ideology is poisonous and should be stoped.. But on the other hand the young people are unemployed the very peaceful Yoruba Muslims in the South are living very peacefully with their Christian relatives. nop mujahids also dont kill any human being and i can proove it through (Qur'an 5:32) so what is mujahid if they don't kill anything? remember 10 years ago there was no boko haram so why now? the question is what went wrong? they were never sent to school by their parents, the North has the almajiri culture, many of their children don't get educated there has always been one thing or the other in the north, the current name is boko haram, yup which is so sad, the Northern Muslims have always been intolerant and violent, it didn't start with boko haram is it a pure lie now buddy?",1
"Canada identifies Muslim convert Michael Zehaf-Bibeau as suspected shooter in Ottawa attack, U.S. officials tell CNN. #OttawaShooting"," Complete the transfer to hawthorn is it very important to mention him as a muslim convert, CNN? it's just labelling and stereotyping isn't? It's reporting the facts... It plays to possible motivation for attacks. Had he been a convert to Buddhism we wouldn't even know his name. Here comes the hysteria. MT: Canada identifies Muslim convert Michael Zehaf-Bibeau as suspected shooter in Ottawa attack. must remember, one bad apple in a barrel doesn't mean all the apples are rotten it is time that the true Muslim communities stop all terrorist acts before they are even a thought - you are responsible -speak out not every fact is relevant for the news. journalism is about sorting and telling relevant facts. A defining moment for Canada? No more Mr. Nice Guy! how many Christian shooters were not reported as ""Christian convert""? Gosh! Even CNN is admitting its a Muslim convert who murdered those poor men for NOTHING.End all Muslim immigration.Who converted him? It was a Canadian CNN that explains it! Canadians are common sense people. So sorry about the 2 soldiers! As I said, it's relevant - recent muslim convert suggests motivation for attack. Otherwise it's just a random attack. no more mister nice guy when this is the 2nd terrorist attack in 3 days by muslim extremists but one bad apple can spoil the bunch This is poor reporting looking for ratings! If he followed Islam he wouldn't of done this. Educate yourself CNN b4 reportn CNN is very selective with words to influence minds. That's bias...not journalism! Because converts to Buddhism don't go around carrying out these type of atrocities THINKBEFOREYOURETWEET All of you politically correct idiots are going to get us all killed. We are at war with Muslim Extremists!!! HELLO the fact he was an islamist is very relevant.ISIS are extreme right wing facists. The new nazis but are there ""christian converts"" going on a shooting spree? the internet. Someone who believes/ practices Islam or Christianity will not be violent. The teachings are against violence. The shooter in Moncton who killed 3 police officers was not called a Christian extremist? We dont call all those who abused/killed the children in residential schools Christian extremists. Repeatedly calling ppl ""Islamist terrorists"" when Islam is against Islam creates hate, stereotypes, &amp; racism Are the KKK or neo-Nazi s called Christian terrorists? That's crazy! So is calling ppl Islamist terrorists. Its the words.They r Terrorists, yes! But dont connect them with Islam. When u do harm is done to innocent ppl! facts are what they are. Never mind words games. Theyre Terrorists who SAY they kill in name of Allah b'cuz of Islam. Wheres the problem w truth they r Islamic terrorist when they so themselves.The left loves playing word games.nit reality no, but a tree with rotten roots needs to be removed. ISLAM So we ignore reality to not offend? ""..if he followed Islam.."" ?!? Have you ever read the Quran and Hadiths? He WAS following Islam. It's the ""moderates"" who don't. no.we call them catholic priests,never any problems with calling Catholics priests paedophiles as thoallare the evidence is to the contrary the majority of victims of Islamists are other Muslims .an islamist is not the same thing as a Muslim Christian terrorists came to N. America n murdered/abused, enslaved/raped Indigenous/ African ppl We dont say that;we know the teachings r bout peace/love. Words do matter if ur r the victim!! In the name of God, Indigenous children/babies were murdered/abused/raped in residential schools. This is not a Christian teachhing. But they said they were doing God's work. Canada's genocide. actually they weren't here, they were brought here. I'm sure you studied history so you know al continued: all races were slaves and America was NOT Nearly close to other nations. Ironic that continued: ironic that we discuss America's faults particularly when the republicans were forme continued: formed to stop slavery that liberal democrats so desperately tried to cling to by the way did you hear what happened in NYC with another Islam terrorist? I agree , the history of white Christians in America /worldwide colonisation /destruction is a disgrace.arabs were big part of slave trade too.and as late as 1700,s Arabs raided uk fishing villages to capture white ppl to enslave/sell in turkey my point is that all!patriarchal religions should be critiqued.none should be given a 'pass'for misogny or anti secular view The shooter was mentally ill. This is what racism/stereotypes created by Othering does- yip .i know what it does,I'm Irish",1

Oh dear, why did he have to wear that fucking handkerchief? Why not focus on the victim of todays tragedy go and fuck your goat. is that the terrorist uniform? And look at that old-school rifle, it's sad that this idiot got as far as he did. Photo of Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, gunman in this morning's shootings in OTTAWA CANADA.

Speak English, you‚Äôre in Canada I don't know. Something to be said for throwing a piece of shit like that into the general population. Oh, oh! Animals are more civilized Got a link to this twitter? No, just saw people tweeting the photo and claiming they got it from an ISIS account earlier. or French? Naturally. I was poking fun at this person‚Äôs earlier tweet  ;) that what I figured. This is o messed up. french is hard to learn  in Montreal no one teach or talk to me french in montreal your face like Taliban Are you kidding? The Qu√©bec gov‚Äôt offers very cheap French classes it also depends on your location too. The small towns around Montreal are quite French.

"Breaking News: U.S. agencies have been advised that #Ottawa shooter was believed to be a #Canadian convert to #Islam, #FoxNews confirms."," A Religion of Peace &amp; Love...üëé That confirms it, just another case of workplace violence !!! was it hard to guess? No kidding. All you have to do is think violence....yep, muslim. Surprising ?? So why not just call this a total global religious war. I find it hard to believe that all people of Islam are out to get us. Fify This is only a surprise if you are a Democrat or a fool so anyone who shoot and kills or bombs is a Muslim this is too low even for Now there's a shock.  How many reps WH sending to his funeral? Because Islam isn't a religion. It's Jim Jones on a global scale! couldn't just be a crazy who happens to claim to be Muslim they have an agenda against Islam always have...why are they he only one's reporting it? They aren't saying every killer is a Muslim terrorist. Just that another Muslim terrorist has killed again. no doubt about it and ppl so quick to believe it. Worldwide Muslims would only have to kill 5 ish ppl each 1/2 Maybe not, but becoming a pretty sure bet. for world domination and yet most don't. Religion of peace yes but like all walks has it's crazies people shoot each other everyday why bring religion into it do they even know the motive behind it??? yes because that's what they keep telling you wake up absolutely you can't blame what one man or a group of fifty does on a billion people that's just hilarious. considering what ISIS has been telling Muslims to do to their home countries, it fits their agenda and terror plans funny how it doesn't work the other way nobody mentions religion in crime unless religion is Islam &gt;fear spreading their religion is also their motivator. So their religion plays a part whether you like it or not. Remember 9/11??? Isis don't represent Islam maybe the united states govt ask I agree. Isis doest rep all of Islam. Only the extreme ones that want every1 dead. Especially Americans. ISIS claims they represent true Islam haha technically they hold true to the real Islamic belief but they are sick fools and you don't usually see people of other religions killing n stupid that you think they way, can you name one Christian, Jews or Hindu terrorist?stop being blind because their religion usually doesn't tell them to murder people who don't believe the ira ? Do I get a prize ? its crazy and the funny thing is people are starting to realize the role media is playing, trying to make Islam look bad ya it all depends on which part of the Koran they choose to follow. Beginning is peaceful but LOL what do you know about 9/11??? Really the end is violent. To deal with these contradictions they are to obey the latter. Which is violent there's more that Islamist terrorists flew two commercial airlines into our towers and killed 6,000 people. Also hijacked a 3rd making us fear our neighbours serves their purpose to take our eyes off the GOP what about the guy who loaded a pickup full of c4 explosives and headed for a mosque in the U S? can you tell me where it says kill someone who does not believe in Islam? just as guilty as terrorism from extremists. What's your point? id be glad to find it for you. But I doubt it would change your mind. So I won't waste my time how about that? you are all blinded the media 9/11 was an inside job ask your govt that cool? what be specific big corporations and the rich are riding high on the wave of fear created by the media luckily there's good ppl who still stand together in unity and don't let fear and hate infect what about student who walks into a school with an automatic rifle and starts shooting at his mates? ""did you see the part ""where they have turned you out"" u defining a whole religion based on 1 verse mentally unstable, mentally ill...those who needed help but weren't helped or never sought help start thinking for yourselves don't let the media do it for u I do not understand communicate with ppl of different walks of life too really!! ....shocking!  actually we all knew that already! how intelligent of you to copy a Wikipedia,u had to do so much hard work to find one terrorist üòùüòù u guys own wikipedia you can't negate why they do it. terrorists do it for their religion usually. End of story. i still named more than u so shhh!! me and matt never said that Islamists are the only ones who commit violence. We are just stating you win I think that's what you want that these terrorists are a real threat. They Americans and people of other religions. Accept the reality of it. To clarify I'm talking bout the extreme ones. NOT all Muslims. was laziness not lack of knowledge anyway :-) wish you didn't have to rely on Wikipedia to talk about Christian terrorism unlike  Islamic  terrorism üòú Mehdi Hassan Oxford Debate on Islam: please stop threatening, I still love my head üòùso peace out !! I don't think u do wish u just want to blame. Why do they target us ? Cos the west is innocent right that is just wrong u should be damned ashamed where's the threat huh? who cares about u I don't and I don't think anyone does I think he knows since he said it lol no amount of discussions will change the fact that these extremists are killing in the name of Allah btw 9/11 was an inside job. extreme Muslims got inside the US and killed thousands. Yes. Inside job from terrorists you think Islam is the threat think twice Truth! shut up you ignorant bitch did you know that there were muslims also killed in the twin towers? And that if it were a white (c) person who committed the crime of 9/11 nobody would be calling all white people terrorists they usually leave that part out oh and I forgot to mention the mosque that was vandalized today in Alberta.. Should I go on? because they're racist ignorant pieces of shit that believe anything thats told to them you obviously missed where I said only the radicalized ones are jihadists. I never called all muslims terrorists. You just assume that. Isis is killing Muslims in the middle east that support peace. Isis is made up of radicalized Muslims that will kill anyone in their way. Including other Muslims.",1
Islamic flag flown as 13 hostages in Sydney's CBD forced against windows http://t.co/qrADRShZqY http://t.co/EaR2kpGSqd," bullshit Dude, the pic was timed about 4 minutes out. Plus, Mashable has like 4M readers. So cover blown LONG before me. Still?... ... stop posting pictures of police! Plus, it is extremely difficult to see where that pic was taken. Can you tell? B/c I can't. As a world security professional, you should be aware that social media is widely used by ""bad guys"". OPSEC dude... I do. But I also know you can't tell shit from that pic. Crazy ... to be clear, he RT'd an article with a pic attached.  Plus, a basic pic of 1 of many sta's w/ERT at post Attached to an article hosted on a major site covering the events. I wouldn't RT anyone local. that would be called a ""Scriven word bubble"" I like ""Scriven word bubble"".  Lol My wife says I do that from time-to-time. Of course you can gain information from that image. Police equipment, volume, composure and location. THANK YOU! Tell that to Mashable. BTW, most bad guys KNOW good guys with cool gear are coming for them. And they're close. I have. Take a look at my first twert I also didn't RT anyone local. Mashable has a readership of 10M and put this on their page. Not current. The image was attached to their article &amp; went to ALL of their followers when it reached me. Dude Mashable is a media - you are a security pro. Ok. This went to ALL of their followers. It's not a secret when 4.81 MILLION followers saw it. I KNOW but you shouldn't encourage them by retweeting ... Sigh..... 4.81 million.I have 2,000. You know what ... I give up ... But as a ""pro"" you shouldn't endorsed and retweet OPSEC stuff. I didn't endorse. I RT an article that already had pic on the webpage. I also did not endorse. When I clicked the RT button, the pic was ALREADY there. Their 4.81 MILLION followers already saw. That doesn't include millions of website views. stop being an idiot bro and go pick another agenda king you tweeted  ""I do. But I also know you can't tell shit from that pic."" I object. Because you're wrong. so seriously though, who takes actionable primary on a US consulate? It's cool and I could be wrong. Check my TL and see if I've ever RT'd anything local. You won't find it. My understanding is Marines cover the grounds but the exterior is locals. Its most probably an isolate situation by lone wolves like we had in Canada in October Come on, don't you watch Homeland? Okay, I just spit my tea. LOL I know that's the deal on an embassy compound but since consulate is tech not US (??) Yeah Me to !! That's good question. Locals then I imagine. Mostly dependent on MOUs from what I gather. well played! Well played! ugh I based that RT on exposure to locals. It's also the ONLY RT where I've done that. Local lone wolves ""greatly"" influenced by ISIS statements. Yup. Which would explain a lot. Hence why a Shahadah flag is used - an amateur. Kinda like what we saw elsewhere. DSS would cover grounds but most ops would be locals. DSS=grounds only if principle was there. That's what I was covering in earlier tweets before we.... By was Left Wide Open Brother. meanwhile... LOL PARTY The entire commentary is hilarious and enlightening. You have it all figured out Jon, I am off to catch up on HOMELAND. dude i know its a parody lol",1
The flag in the window of the Lindt cafe in Martin Place is not an Islamic State flag. An explanation: http://t.co/PD570btTiZ #SydneySiege," yes!Hola! What can you say?Qu√© escuch√°s ??? For now, there is no official report.The flag would not be Isis.Everything is cut and evacuated.ABBOT PRY PRY PRY in approx 1h They will offer information as soon as they have it available.The operation is huge. Total surprise, right?How is Sidney security theme usually ??? A few days ago, he said little policeman is seen.The city is very safe.I only saw the anti -terrorism brigade in the bay. Holaaa !!Evening Alla ?? It is a schedule of full activity, right?Is the place a lot of movement?Is it a famous coffee? yes!!! It is a very famous coffee because it is in Mart√≠n Place that is full center.Yes, it's time for full activity throughout the city The fame of coffee is because it represents the firm Lindt of chocolates.The operation is still. Uhhh holidays or work? Both. Australia has men accompanying US forces at some key point?You know that? Are you close to the place? about 25 blocks.Half an hour walking. Exact.Here they say, the locals, that this is due to the heard that he gave to the USA.Let me check. I meant, Australian support to Obama. pretty close.Had you gone to that coffee? They are always support.They came saving. Do you feel that there is fear?Or is there tranquility and confidence in security forces? Since I arrived, a month ago, everyone knew that the city was on orange alert. And there were no major measures ??? Something was seen in the bay.The Opera House very quiet as well as tourist areas.The same trains and buses. What are you doing there?Did you go for a long time?Would you already know? In general, the city looked, until yesterday, filled by the Christmas spirit.A lot of people, tourists, a lot of enthusiasm x nye. Do not forget that a few days are missing for the great fireworks party and, in the port area 2m of Pers come together I came for the first time in 85. Now, I stay until the end of January.I have friends and family. Wow.What will they do with that ... On Saturday I was in the area and it was all party and joy.It happened to you some photos, do you want? People are very confident.No, I don't notice fear.In fact, the family with whom I live asked me not to go to City. Nothing more than that.They continue with their work away from home and I with mine in the computer. Look, there is no talk of the subject.What I can assure you is that everything is reserved. So far you had never had a run for something there?How do you live day by day? You live perfect.Quiet, relaxed, people are cordial, kind.All impeccable.I was in monuments where everything was fine I only saw the bay brigade one Sunday afternoon, it was a black boat, huge, with uniformed TB police dressed in black. Do you review you a lot when you enter public places?Do you see police or guards? nothing, absolutely nothing.Visit the memorial Anzac that is in the middle of the city and remembers the fallen at war. I was in the tower called Center Point and they didn't review me either.Neither me, nor anyone. I am very surprising to see women with their husbands using burkas.But, here each respect for the other The question is whether something like this will change everyday life and security measures or everything will continue as before. ""With their husbands using burkas"" it is not the same as ""with their husbands. Useing burkas"" or ""using burkas, with their husbands"";);) What pavada ... I put the coma badly.They use teasing, husbands go to the side.My apologies. So far we have no news.We are waiting for Tony Abbot's speech. If there is something for what is TW, it is to make inconsequential comments.;) hug. All good, the grammatical police does not rest.",1
"The Lindt store refuses to be halal certified perhaps thats why they were targeted. #jihad #Sydney #hostagecrisis
http://t.co/gAEf9aHB8v"," Speculation! There are many products that are not Halal. This man can't love chocolate that much. What about Kosher? - Kosher isn't demanded, it's made &amp; advertised doesn't blackmail. Have you seen how Muslim kill the animals. Muslim kill their animals the same way as kosher. Only Kosher outright refuse to stun first. What are you on about? Blackmail? If there is a demand there is money to make, so no need to blackmail. - Haven't ever seen that. Halal is blackmail by thugs &amp; businesses that buy into it can do w/o my &amp; many others $ - Right. Is that why WALMART has caved to these terrorists &amp; carries halal products now? Americans should BOYCOTT Walmart. Huh.. its just meat. Not drugs. I don't know where you got that from. Sounds nutty and without facts. - I can't remember sign but look on food all kinds &amp; it's there. Like KFC, subway, etc. I won't support it ever. - Subway won't provide sani wipes anymore b/c of alcohol in them. Enough is enough. yay for tolerance! Reference please. Sounds like cutting costs to me. Availability of alcohol wipes does mean one has to use them! &lt;‚Ä¢ what does Kosher have to do with with the SHAHADAH in the window? - They said that's why they dropped using them. Muslim complaints. If they don't like our country then leave. If they were for staff use,  good on them for providing an alternative. If it was for the customers, that would be ridiculous - No it was for customers. Also was problems with them serving bacon. Now the bacon I haven't heard anymore. I won't buy KFC - Their was a list of companies that were halal compliant. As for leaving the country. Think that is an extreme reaction over alcohol wipes. So? That probably also means veterinarian.. yay for me! - You know it's just not that. You give them a inch they take a mile &amp; that goes for so called moderates. Coz you hate Muslims? Or love bacon. Its a business, they will work towards the customer base. Don't see the problem. - Where's all the protest against all this savagery. Silence screams approval. - You can be sure there's more non Muslim buying the goods. It's our caving, our PC police in overtime. Again .. errr what? Are you taking about ISIS ?! Coz if so you are being ignorant as most the victims are Muslims.. Lack of media coverage or you looking it up has more to do with the apparent silence. -Not just ISIS but any terrorist activity. Much of the jihadi is done at mosques, ppl know who's involved, silence? you are presuming guilt by association. Ppl are fed up of being profiled am being treated like criminals. - Your an apologist, we have a problem &amp; belittling it won't make them our friends &amp; it won't go away. - I'll believe it when I see it. Not before. If I know about this stuff they do. - Then don't associate with criminals. Judged by company you keep. The ppl don't relate to the terrorist. And yet we tell them they should carry the guilt for it. Should i carry guilt.. for all veterinarians that have ever committed a crime? Or every women? or Ahiest? So all American are guilty of killing innocent Iraqi/ Afghani/ Pakistani ppl? Funny the Christian majority countries are doing all the bombings but its the Muslims that are terrorists. - LOL! Perhaps you forgot about 3000+ killed 9/11. Gee in most ME countries they danced on streets. Why is the bombing happening ? Is it possible that it's a reaction to Islamic barbaric actions ? -Why is EU having such problems. Sharia only areas &amp; courts. Women wearing sheets, no thank you. No sharia here. So how many ppl have to die before we feel satisfied? Gather you have neither been to the middle east or have any Muslim or Middle Eastern friends. Or you would know alot think its an inside job because they don't agree with 9/11 !!!! -Look this comes down to protecting what we have. Why would anyone take a chance of Muslim control. Women are dirt No. Iraq had nothing to do with AlQaida  &amp; everything to do with oil &amp; we used chemical weapons on them! - That's the wonderful thing about a non Muslim democratic state, we can disagree. Your not being honest with yourself. 9/11 was conducted Saudi Osama &amp; hijackers.. but we didn't bomb Saudi. As they sell us oil cheap. Well , you got me there . I simply cannot argue any point if you want to ignore the truth . Again, you are ignorant of the facts . Bin Laden was a big threat to the Saudis for many years before 9/11 NO, am a realist. The problem has to be solved on both sides. You can't solve with only one party! - Your right, &amp; they don't want to be""fixed"" they want it their way. The Quran in many passages calls 4 death of all that - Don't turn Muslim. That's why so called Muslims are silent. Will they go against Quran. No.",1
Praying for the safety of all the hostages being held by some criminal in the cafe in Sydney. Preparing for the collective blame as well.," depressing how many people appear to believe in guilt-by-association + collective punishment in supposedly civilised societies I'm in a building just across the street from the police cordon, FWIW. Thoughts with the poor hostages. Just hope it ends well it's not a phobia to be wary of a religious people that want to kill you because their religion tells them to. whoa! There are plenty of us in the West that don't blame all Muslims for the acts of a few. Unfortunately inevitable &amp; I'm deeply fearful for what will come in Australia after this... What a nightmare. Sick of base generalizations of all Muslims being one monolith. So are all Christians one too? I'm not Terry Jones's homegirl. 1/n)Beg to agree wid partly. How about collectiv silenc, no protest or voices raisd agaijst killings, etc? 2/n) Does that no amount to an indirect collective support/association by dat part of d society/community? If u choose to not blame collectivey read some TLs on Twitter, including mine. Posts onFB, interviews I do follow you regularly &amp; appreciat ur views. D problem starts wen we as a society adopt a stoic silence And d forces indulging in ill deeds take d silence 4m d community as a Big Approval &amp; stay on d same path. I often neglect to denounce violence committed by white people; just too much of it. Am I guilty of something? Society is ppl. Read javedakhtarjadu all knwn voices Surprised I am. Your aomission of not denouncin d violence by white people shows d values we hold close 2our chest There you go with that guilt-by-association fallacy again. it isn't anybody's responsibility to denounce every activity they haven't explicitly declared their support for. Nah. Having something in common (country; religion; skin; hobby) doesn't make me responsible for others' actions Strange you sound. Playing safe, no explicit denouncing. Right human nature? Yes, Gareth. Sigh! maniac taking hostages is terrible.I don't need to express this view; I'm white, so people just assume I hold it Quite lucky.Never been in a situation where people assume I support atrocities just b/c I fail to denounce them. Agreed, dat havin religion, skin, etc, in common doesn't make U responsibl 2oders' acts bt, U2 are impacted by it. Muslims have lived in western societies for CENTURIES in peace why don't bigots like you ask ""why is this stuff only happening NOW? instead of hating on a billion people like they're all the same &amp; all out to kill you? Why don't you explain it to us ""bigots?"" why should I bother since you ignorant bigots have NO interest in even TRYING to have a open mind the US bombs &amp; incinerates civilians for YRS but that's perfectly ok to moral hypocrites like you That was a very loose Assumption you made there ! You don't know how ""open ""our micds are ,Hows about fuck off hilarious that u send me a photo of an ISIS beheading--a group that would not exist were it not for US invasion of Iraq Its simple really. If you aren't happy with the USA...LEAVE. It would be a better place without u. & lt; & lt; & lt; --- Burn Bitch! got that, moron? ISIS wld NOT exist were it not for US disastrous foreign policy - so STFU ignorant bigots accusing others of ignorance and bigotry. Oooh that's my favorite. STFU, worthless lowlife scumbag filth how about YOU fuck off, asshole? Amen Your Insane Aw, you've wounded me so much! F-off! Joy to the world! Yeah. Hilarious. You piece of shit. so tell me again who we invaded on 9/11 idiot so tell me again WHO invaded a country that HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH 9/11, MORON yes it is aright with me, another communist idiot - you're one sick woman - I'm sure the are aware of your sympathies with ISLAMIST terrorists to me it is hilarious what a dumb ass you are. if you do not like the way we do things here then go back to Brazil !!!!!!! to me it is hilarious that u think I give a shit what a congenital moron asshole like you thinks of me- hahahaha arguing with idiots That's 0bamas drone program.No prisoners,no hearings,no Gitmo detainees. &amp; what makes you think I support Obama?",1
Uber Sydney trips from CBD will be free for riders. Higher rates are still in place to encourage drivers to get into the CBD.," thank you for fixing this situation. that's like the most confusing statement ever. The social media department of Uber Sydney is high or something? Trying to get in contact, anyone at the phones? you really gotta stop the swarm model or at least have someone actually look at WHY an area is swarming. how about paying your drivers extra to go into the cbd instead of forcing others to pay extra to travel into potential danger? swarming because of a concert or event? Fine. Swarming during a hostage crisis? NOT COOL. so is uber paying for the rides paying the drivers? So are rides free or more expensive? Your tweet is very unclear who's paying then? calm down its one cafe. what does this mean? that's better RT: Uber Sydney trips from CBD will be free for riders. Higher rates still in place to encourage drivers it's still raising prices when people are trying to leave the CBD in a crisis. At least they've made rides free now is public transport free? so free or surge pricing? CONFUSED wait, does 'higher rate' mean what is paying drivers? CLARIFICATION reports around the world flooding in of your 400% fare increase in response to a siege situation, smart. Yeah I think so. They're getting $100+, riders aren't wearing diff. Good gesture. Poor message transmission nope. I respect them for making the rides free, I can also see how they wanted to get more drivers in initial message did imply that riders can cop hike. Much better. so our GOVERNMENT is making money from people trying to get out of a hostage situation but you don't shout and yell at them... but you do Uber for trying to increase drivers. My work here is done your honour. What do you pay your drivers? Seems. A global marketing disaster Uber is trying to fix. you're aware that this tweet ...is giving away free rides, right? Glad I'm not the only one who's confused ... Every TAXI can take a M40 $30 discount voucher. But then GUBER isn't public transport. Uber is. the surge rates are to draw the drivers there (uber will pay the cost). No fee to passengers. Ah that makes sense then thanks didn't make it very clear in the beginning. no idea what you mean? Taxis all offer $30 discount to disabled passengers, UBER doesnt even have disabled taxis to offer. That's true PT No, you refused to pay for them to be at the phones. Enjoy your walk. don't know if your being sarcastic or going of topic You called uber public transport, it's not. PT is for everyone not just the elite. The rides are free. will be paying the drivers the increased rate out of their own pocket. I never called uber PT. Everyone is having a go at Uber but not PT... We own it,we shouldn't have to pay in desperate times I'm baffled by how few of its customers actually know how Uber works. for the transport service I don't run? Excellent point sir. If they wanted to save money, they should've kept quiet. U don't pay extra for PT at desperate ‚åö. My apologies if I got the issue confused. I agree PT for everyone regardless of class. for sure people expect Uber drivers to work for normal/free in ""crisis times"" but when Uber increases prices 2 get more drivers than It is an illegal bloody service. Why don't you thank regular taxi drivers?Encouraging theft are we? everyone cries how bad it is... Yet public transport is still usual price and no one is whining at them. Same people pro do sweet all but moan on social media about how terrible everyone else is.. And yes irony burning my end. I see your point. Maybe should make transport free from the CBD today. That is the point, dummy. Lots of drivers signing up for Uber. They are smarter than you. So help out and shut it This is a ubers drivers forum, not sponsored by uber. Read what it's like in a mature uber market. I'm kinda new to (active) twitter but I can see the praises of a knee jerk reaction. It highlights the collective mind issues. wow, what an asinine remark. They went for a PR scoop and fucked it, now they're scrambling to fix it. Seems smart how about you fuck off back to your corner of the internet where your opinion matters and I'll do the same. Listen up dum-dum.  They ARE paying the drivers more. Reading is a skill. Man, you're dumb. Sorry for saying anything,  dummy. No, they presumed their customers weren't economic illiterates. They presumed wrong. Being literate in economics is out of favor these days. Bad for politics. Uber trips out of the CBD today are free to help Sydneysiders get home safely. See Uber trips out of the CBD today are free to help Sydneysiders get home safely.

Be mad but also be fair. Wait.He's using women as shields?!?!?Muslims NEVER do that!&lt;sarc off&gt;PFFFTHAMASISLAMRELIGIONOFPEACEMYASS Spot on Amy please use that logic as if people really fully represent the religion they claim to be a part of The actions of the Muslims that terrorize and kill perfectly match with the teachings in the Qur'an and Hadith.THEMOREYOUKNOW savage Not all Muslims are terrorist, but all terrorist are Muslim! 'women used as shields'. Sound familiar?  Hint:  Hamas. flash bang, two shots center of mass. Problem solved. Come on AUSTRALIA. I read a bit of the Koran recently &amp; Radical Islam is the teachings of the Koran taken to extremes &amp; literally. Then I gave up reading it and used the heavy-duty office shredder to mulch it. go say that to the Hindus in my parents country that were bombing the Buddhists &amp; Muslims.u know nothing you can do that with even the Bible can you not? Are you getting your Quran interpretations from some Islam hating websites :b wow ur so cool hail satan I demand Mosques to be burned to the ground. ohh yea I saw thought. Sorry I forgot to untag your name but I will the next they me üòÅ Should never be built. LOL. Islam and democracy cannot coexist. Islam is a religion for slaves and fools, Islam and Communism are identical. let's Rock , Paper, Scissor and take a guess! He's  Terrorist , Duhh Its those angry Amish again Gotta be. Or Mennonites. All pretty scary. NOPE Its all about context. show me what verses but tbh I'm not a fan of any abrahamic religion. They are all evil to me. Surah:30:45 Allah doesn't love non believers3:32 Allah doesn't love those who turn away from him5:51 who not be friends with that last one: 5:51 Jews &amp; Christians... Meanwhile...Romans 5:8 ""...while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.""God loves:non-believers, those who turn away... There's lots more on both sides...If you'll have patience (I have to work) I'll put it all out there.Or you can read 4 urself You're a Muslim, I assume, JustNat? Read Koran? It's very Us v Them and Them cannot live. why would you assume I'm Muslim? I'm Buddhist. And no I haven't but I don't see why ppl attack Islam like it's any worse than their religions. I've have a Bible &amp; Quran and even though I haven't finished them or plan to finish them. I have seen verses in both that are disturbing. They both are just as bad. So bash both. The RT was for the 2nd half of I got it that u weren't Muslim.That being said, tell me where Christ says... to punish or even kill those who don't believe.Allah proves that he is not the same God as many profess... by saying the opposite of what Jesus says.They are not both bad. but theres also verses in the Quran that tell u if u kill one person it's as if you killed all of humanity idk it's just a very contradicted religion to me. It's all a bunch of nonsense to me. I just don't like how one religion of nonsense gets bashed more than the other. That is very insightful of you. If you were to highlight the Qur'an in 2 diff colors, one for loving Allah... and one for hateful, spiteful Allah, the book would be striped. Loving/Hateful/Loving/Spiteful... Allah is capricious. He can't be trusted. He changes his mind to fit his narrative.  Muhammad did the same. As much as people would want to say that the God of the Bible is the same, He doesn't change. He is love. what religion are you? I follow Christ. I can't abide by ""organized religion"".The Bible is truth. Religion is man trying to.. cover his inadequacies before a perfect God. Gotta run. Would love to talk to you more. alright well have fun running and thanks for your time Oh, its not that kinda running - my car has a ""0.0K"" sticker.:-) No prob. Any time u want to talk. I am no religion. Everyone has a right to their own beliefs. But don't force beliefs on society. &amp; no beheadings! Problem arises w/blindly following anything/anyone. Question, examine, reconcile it w/ pers beliefs. Dogma is the greatest form of ignorance.",1
"""At least 1 gunman"" in #SydneySiege (image of suspect not verified) No injuries known - police http://t.co/XLklHFHCT3 http://t.co/Rxh3RH2RMS"," hope Aussies have deployed snipers to gun him down I heard that the glass is bullet resistant apparently the glass in most of the buildings around there  is bullet resistant. NSW police have asked press not to speculate over this person or their identity. Does posting a picture comply? another mad bastard with a scarf round his face Ummm, where's the gun? Australian Muslim groups condemn SYDNEYSIEGE in statement: ""This is a time for all Australians to stand together"" Swap the word ""community"" for ""ghetto"" then read it again. I am from Australia this is just crazy What about Australia's Christians, Jews, Hindus, Athetists and Buddhists? What do they have to say? Why does it matter?! | Great PR response from AUSTRALIAN MUSLIM groups to SYDNEYSIEGE. Very important for them to make such statement. I've seen that headband somewhere before... is it Pat Cash? It is bad that the Muslim community have to denounce this. Do other religions do this?....I don't see local Vicars doing this.. Because its important for MUSLIMS to be able to define what ISLAM should be and not ignore its problems? Reality is that most misery in the world today happens in name of Islam.No wonder people turn away massively from this religion | Perhaps you shoukd read the statement from Muslim groups. A manipulation of a faith statement for politics not on Nice sentiment, however the world's tax dollars are being used to fight this trash. DOBETTER bullet resistant up to what caliber? It matters coz now evryone's like;..&lt; MUSLIMS are TERRORISTS which is not true That's not what the self-professed Australian Muslim leader interviewed on BBC was saying this morning. probably enough to divert a sniper shot. Even if it penetrated, thus spooking the dude and he may kill &amp; no wonder many are massively joining ""this"" religion;., those who have cared to find the reality beneath all this do you have a link? Want to see it. maybe that's because he's self professed, not representative, you clowns Exactly. Sad that it needs to be reaffirmed for the small minded people who will use this as an opportunity to scapegoat. Then why is the BBC giving him airtime. That's my point. what happend to being able to tell from right and wrong? I guess you lack empathy. Racist girl what a load of bollocks I would just give the guy his on air tv time, that's clearly what he wants Are these guys more representative, maybe? I found in counter strike, magnum sniper gun can penetrate most of the glasses used in buildings at least it's something lol I dont know if Counter-strike is the best comparison. Maybe the cops play it alot, who knows for the fact, it has become the biggest religion of the world and the fastest growing religion too. these grps try to defame islam.they go jst opposite to d teachings of islam to damage it.Islam means Peace in arabic Most cases  terrorists harboured by same Muslim groups, who later claim innocence That's Muslims assuring against repressive laws as being counter productive, not supporting terrorism. I'm not racist and hate that everyone who has something to say about that religion is ""a racist""! What dos that make u: ignorant? meanwhile they're saying what evil people we all are it's almost as though the media will pick up any extreme view to create a bit of controversy. But they'd never do that right? So you agree that Aussie Muslims waging jihad in Syria are comparable to Jewish Aussies joining the IDF? so you cant identify the paid government MI6 empoyees...100% false flag government hoax Why the hell would you join this religion? And what reality? I only see misery, suppression of women and no fun at all! Then why are you calling me a clown for calling them out on it. Sorry not for me. total false flag set up by the government Has it been stated that the hostage taken is a Muslim? (I don't know, not able to keep up with the events) Great article on rise of Middle Eastern crime in Australia; particularly in Sydney ISLAMICIDE  ‚Ä¶ Has it been stated that the hostage taken is a Muslim? (I don't know, not able to keep up with the events) u see, you're sounding ignorant;., bt i don't blame u;., that's the perception you're mind has been influenced to have Has it been stated that the hostage taken is a Muslim? (I don't know, not able to keep up with the events) no, you're just a racist in denial who thinks they're a genuine person lol HYPOCRITE ha huh!! and who says religion is all about having ""fun'???? |It's a complex situation with a mix of fear and sympathy guiding behaviour. Maybe, but that's not what we see. Maybe the peaceful Moslims should massively turn themselves away from these terrorists? It has been reported that the hostages are holding up flags with the Shahada (Islamic affirmation) nuns aren't taking hostages, radicalized Muslims are. The actions are religiously motivated and its important MUSLIMS condemn these antisocial bits of their religion I don't care what religion you believe in, just don't bother me with it. I'm questioning tarring all members of any community with the same brush based on the actions of minorities. Not to hand, you can probably search iplayer for it. yeah ok. like everything else. there are no bad people Only evil governments. because it came across as though you were calling the Australian Muslim community out, not challenging the BBC no worries. I will search youtube. Keep up the good work! You know, maybe we'll never agree, but there are different religions and all are important to those who believe. lol. Nobody bothered you.. It's actually you that's doing the bothering by being a racist! If that is the case, then yes, I completely agree! u shoulda said that to yo self be4 making all those  false accusations :) Glad to be able to help you clarify, fellow code monkey! Both should be called out. Media needs to stop giving airtime to extremists. Muslims need to do more. Actions not words. so if you abandon Islam you'll be ""raceless""?  Islam is not a race, so she is not a racist! what actions do you suggest? Forehead tattoos saying 'I'm a nice one'? what actions instead of words should I as a Brit be making to suitably attone for my countrymen's mistakes? what actions are Israelis doing to show they find all stand by the worst excesses of their state? well then you better go on the internet and check again: . Islam means submission! well they probably  know that it will be their members that will suffer on the street. Depends which ones you're referring to. 1) Public protest, 2) take action on extremist preachers, 3) take action on extremist schools agreed, so strange that innocent Muslims may get abuse from this but if another religion was involved... you wouldn't get the same. Innocent Christians wouldn't get abuse if this was a Christian terrorist. Not sure what you mean by that but Israelis protest against their government all the time. All religions have radicalism and individuals who do unthinkable acts. You only ever seem to have innocent... Muslims having to or choosing to publicly  speak out against the actions. I just find it strange that's all. Just ... Stop Talking Dumb Ass I see a lot of racists like to pretend Islam is a race, not a religion, so they can shout ""racist"" at people. Look at reaction in Bangladeshi community to exposure of extremist schools in Tower Hamlets. Instead of outrage that their kids are being brainwashed, the parents close up and claim victimisation. They deny there's a problem, and if there is it's the fault of the rest of us. Well guess what there IS a problem. Sure ... üòÇ wow immediately insulting! How peaceful and tolerant! Logic outside of your grasp? you're actually trying to look smart? Lol by contrasting to you, you mean? 'how peaceful and tolerant' lol you're a racist in denial as well yep, so you are focused on one set of people only. Ignoring anything positive and focusing on the negative. Ta ta Your reaction isn't rational. your is is gods a douche bag lol I can't take you seriously oww i am hurt, i am not being taken seriously by a fool! omg please don't call me a fool :( how peaceful and tolerant :( just returning the favor. If you think Islam is a race, please show how white and black Muslims have the same race. how considerate of you Mr. Genuine, thank you so much Maybe tell the 30-40 people held at gunpoint in Sydney that they should stop focussing on the negative? Situation not helped by lefties screaming ""Islamaphobia"" to shutdown debate, then they wonder where far-right groups come from. regardless.. If you're rude and offensive towards a kind of people then you're a racist You are to Racist !! If you look at the TL of you can see he is homophobic as well. not if it is about religion, in which case it is bigotry, not racism. Learn English first. awww you had to go to my TL to use something else against me? Hahahahaha but what made you say that smarty pants ? you are welcome! do you think my is a coincidence?? can you be my English tutor please and teach me about bigotry and racism as well ?? so... Bigotry is acceptable ehh no way dude!! Rock on He also likes to call people faggots, retards, and trolls, because he feels inferior. does he now?  He's a naughty boy indeed, isn't he? BINGO! Point out what's written in their books and they're own demands yet somehow you're the racist one... It's a good sign that a person doesn't have anything to write that is worth reading. Muslims never take responsibility always play the victim or blame everyone else No Need, you are an expert at it. 500,000 Muslims can march on London to protest Israel defending itself, but not against Islamic extremism. that planetary vision at him by is that you? COOLSHT Nobody said that, as you well know -  a very obvious sleight of hand and fools nobody. someone is making a move! that is me, yes. Eh? you cannot tell that from my TL, but yours is very revealing in its hatred, abuse, bigotry, and racism. someone likes to meet you and be thought a lesson!  Very sm! He's just a fool ... pfffff unimportant person I have no problem with people, but what they may represent. because the Bible didn't have similar in it? You bunch of loons no they don't you just chose not to see anything not conforming your own prejudice you can't defend yourself in illegally occupied land. Get that through your thick skull Bible changed, Quran refuses to. I guess he lost the argument... it's still in there you fool. what, by saying something you disagree with? you only support condemning one group, spreading hate. If he hasn't blocked you, could you tell him that he just proved my point about the left shutting down debate? You proved words. And what you see in Islam is what you see in Old Testament. I don't see slavery, rape &amp; genocide on non believers in the bible. I do in the Quran though. ISIS proves it! You need to look harder. no I don't. You need to accept that Islam the truths yourself instead of pushing it another way. Diff Christians don't go around pulling out an eye for an eye - Christianity is about love not hate Eye for an eye is about limits on justice, not on retribution. Israel has a tiny proportion of land and used to have much bigger and yet you deny them this I love Israel good brief you really have no idea of history do you? I think you will find is you that have no idea of history and would rather support terorists than Israel democracy load of bollocks so what does that mean? Assumptions much... wrong again. These actions r politically motivated and religion being used. This hostage crap is in no religion at all. Just because someone's interpretation of religion differs from yours doesn't make it any less religious wrong interpretation does. Obviously you're too young to remember the height of Northern Ireland troubles. Catholic Priests were doing that. LOL stop trying to cover up the fact that you're a racist how peaceful and tolerant of you guys, especially Mariska, she knows all the right and wrongs yeah pls :( In fact yes I do! üòå you're denying it now? Or were u just trying to suck up to the racist girl?? you don't understand things easily, do you? We already explained the difference with bigotry Charles Darwin and inspector kmtildsley over here call that bigotry, Mariska miss empathy yeah clearly denying what ? My knowledge of English and the difference between racism and bigotry ? He does understand. To cover his embarrassment he is trying to stone us to death with snow It's like talking to a child. ty for referring to me with one of the great minds in history who debunked the creation myth! he just wants to invite us to a game of nonsense ping-pong.  He obviously is great at that! I'm afraid so and take your point.That said, heard the terrorists in Sidney are Iranian not Muslim at all!! And the IRA weren't Christian. It didn't stop until the general public started condemning it. it's bad they need to jump to their defence every time an individual/group, regardless of religion, acts like an idiot The problem is that it's ""spokesmen"". It needs ""normal"" Muslims to stand up. It needed that in Northern Ireland. It needs it here.",1
"Jews, Catholics, Muslims, white people, black people. Everyone attacked by Charlie Hebdo, yet who reacts like this? http://t.co/fkvhfJxPoO"," So it's just Muslims in general we should be concerned about, nothing to do with identified terrorist groups. important point: similar but different to ISIS folks. Not the same thing, probably just a single disconnected nutbag. no. Dipstick, it's nothing to do with muslims in general. Perverted Vision? They follow the book. Fact is, it's not a very nice book. Hate Speech It has everything to do with Muslims in general. Are you another communist? You lot are out in force today. About as nice as the Bible. - Getthemhomesafely Clearly not so innocuous as far as the perpetrators here are concerned. oh you're a professional troll - in lieu of having an actual purpose in life? Evolve or die already. it's a book on how to conduct life, and sometimes life isn't nice, hence why we should pursue peace now then anyone else gutted that this is all happening in a chocolate shop... üíî IDIOTS! What they are doing opposes the very banner they are putting up! Did Allah or Prophet Muhammad SAW tell u 2 do that? ! No not really. But then we've grown up and dumped it. About time they did the same I mean innocuous in so far as the flag is actually just like a muslim prayer cloth. Its use here is awful. Not a troll, just have a different opinion to you. All communists identify dissent as trolling. that there's an idiot with a black flag. What is BBC trying to imply? ""BOO! IT'S A TERRORIST! BE AFRAID LIKE THE SHEEP YOU ARE!"" A book promoted by a known, War Lord &amp; Rapist. Nice start to a religion Hey Ross. How about a bum root? By the way, if you knock me back you're a homophobe. okay so who was raped and warlord? You've been reading to much out of context material IGNORENT Oh, youre gonna re write history......ignorant? Pot Kettle You tell me. Are there rules when it's okay &amp; not okay to rape women, in THAT book? well the qu'ran I read does not condone rape, adultery and abuse of women, the most U can do is... is use the force of a small stick on a shoulder as a last resort, so what ""rape"" are you talking about? I don't need too tbh, it seems your account for knowledge is skewed. I think u need to find better reading material Hadith 4.24. By the way Ignorant is not spelt with an 'e' I suggest u should maybe approach someone that is a qualified Islamic scholar, who can provide theological based u need Even this conversation is disturbing in itself. That the ambiguity over rape &amp; Islam even exists, is so sad why does the caption above photo say it symbolizes engagement in jihad. because they are misinformed. Muslim woman came on tv HOURS ago and explained that it was NOT the ISIS flag sorry IS flag, whatever...brain is exploding as far as I can tell, the letters are certainly Arabic but they're gibberish, strung together randomly. So you're saying it's Arabs that are the problem? I'm saying in this picture, specifically, someone doesn't know how to write syntactical Arabic. Plenty of people in Australia who don't even know how to write syntactical English. and what book of had its, not all Hadith are authentic btw. The BBC also say that. They say similar but not the same. PS yes holding it up for some reason. last time I checked that wasn't in the Quran, women are highly respected. + +And secondly, don't forget the bible though it was okay to stone babies Islam will never condone rape or any other abuse, like I said, opinions of twisted schoolers and unauthentic hadiths can't speak for a religion. You know the difference between Hadith and the qu'ran right? Yes, and we've dumped that book &amp; become a secular society. And there are rules on rape in the book I mean think about it logically, how can a society that the qu'ran wanted to lead exist with things like barbarism and rape. like I said u should get your questions and approach some educated Islamic scholars or theologians who can give u the awsners I might be wrong, but one is written by a God, and one by men? I've no religion well what I would say, Islam has held back these societies. Like Christianity did in Europe, in the Middle Ages you're probably not even muslim how would you know and understand rules in and out of the book??! Muhammad and the early Muslims presided over a great deal of massacres, rape and slavery actually. Not being the IS flag does not means it's not a banner for Jihad. Jihad is pretty central to Islam. That's the unpalatable truth the right-on brigade continue to skirt round. Maybe the rape and sexual enslavement justified here: And practiced by Islamic State, Boko Haram etc. Also, there is no such thing as marital rape in Islam. Yea, maybe a qualified scholar like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has a PHD in Islamic Studies. Why are there Hadiths that say that most of the residents of hell are women who were ungrateful to their husbands if they're so respected in Islam? When 90% of all murder, violence, oppression and rape in history falls at the feet of men? ask that to other men, the bible thought it was okay to stone babies but that ain't none of my business What proportion of Christians do you think believe the Bible is infallible today? How many even know stuff like that is in there? Now: how many Muslims believe the Qur'an to be the infallible command of Allah? there are many verses opposite of that and, as many don't understand, verses have multiple meanings and different interpretations Course they do. It's a religion of peace. the qu'ran is the word of God, passed down via the angel Gabriel to Mohammed (pbuh) hadiths on the other hand are recordings of traditions and reports by the companions of the prophet Muhammad (pbuh) that translation for one is not something I can explain I'll be honest. as for him, I doubt he will give u a level headed answer in anything. I certainly wouldn't take his word or theorys your quoting mass terrorists groups that have killed more Muslims than anything... u can't expect them 2 even respect the religion when they killing their own people. ILLOGICAL political agendas have held back Islam and society, just as it helped create chemistry, algebra, medicine and astronomy u can check a guy out from Glasgow called shaykh amer Jamil, he specialise in family support and guidance. He's on youtube Bullshit. Stop being such a fucking cop out. Jihad is Jihad. uh?Cos i can read but no one is stoning babies in 2015. Move on from that one Not ISIS, hurrah! So hostages won't be beheaded, but at risk of death by shooting. Turns out hostage taker is Iranian, so a Shia and implacably opposed to/by ISIS. it is just important to get facts right, misinformation is dangerous What's your point? The hostage taker is actually just a nut job. And has he not declared himself a recent convert to Sunnism anyway? That's what I heard. So now we have to worry about Shiites also. Who said otherwise? Shiite Happens From some comments I read u would think most Islamist want to have us over for tea. I just dont think we should judge others based on religion, race, sexual orientation or political views Get your head out of your arse. I WILL judge people if Islam or any other ideology makes them disgusting Bigot. You'd probably want to put me up against the wall for being a ""disgusting faggot"" too yeah? Excuse me? I think you'll find that's a common view among fundamentalist Muslims. Not me, you ignorant fucking piece of shit. If you are actually gay, Islam is your worst enemy. Get fucking real, dickhead. Better why r u discusting. lol, islam isnt my worst enemy, predjudice is. I sympathise with people who are hated for no good reason please give us your references you forget the history if the crusades! Yea! And once upon a time, Islamic civilisation gave us Algebra!How long ago was that again? What since? Since you bring up the Crusades, how was the Levant, N. Africa, Turkey, S. Asia largely converted to Islam? Did the Arabs entice the Kuffar with dates and miswaks? Ever heard of the Banu Qarayza tribe? Or the fates of many of the early Caliphs? Karbala in 680 A.D.? you are a person lacking focus and clearly have no focus depth to your knowledge or argument so don't waste my time! i always wonder why certain things were ok for mo but frowned upon for isis? Like mass execution and sexual slavery? yep...exactly like that.  Destruction of property. ..list goes on.. which means struggle, if u mean deluded holy war, u know worked for Mossad before this shit truth is, no normal Muslim backs him, just desperate people that have nothing. TRUTH again please back your claims with actual proof not speculation never mind crusade what about CIA interrogation! CIAREPORT and there are many civilized Muslims that respect women and children get over it dickhead Name calling......oh dear the ones the West has been killing non stop maybe? Muslims? They would react the same even if the west pulled out of every Islamic country. Why are some people of this faith so afraid of criticism that they react to violence each time? How do you know who was attacked? Or who the attackers were. How dare anyone blame Islam...It is the Jews...or the Hindus? This will be used to persecute innocents unfortunately muhammadan cunts are really really sensitive, they use stones instead of water every morning,it hurts/burns u see Nice to see a ""libertarian"" advocating community/ group responsibility. no I'm ok, but thanks for your concern knew NewsCorp be the first to react like that who? Obviously, followers of religion of peace a small, outlying gang of fanatics that bear no real relation to any larger movement, group of people or belief? What do I win? Yeah like the 10 innocent people that have been killed Why, do you know who did it? we have no idea yet, and speculation makes you look silly, remember Anders Brevik He never said he did I was wondering why you listed so many types of people who had been attacked. We don't know who was shot You don't know who has been shot - it may have been lots of groups or just one. No he means attacked by the magazine. As in satirised sorry I misread it. My foolishness. But one race is not ""better"" than another,there are other ways - ALL papers to print Hebdo fronts quite, it's repeated invasions that were the problem Do you mean the invasion by Muslims into European Countries? MASSIMMIGRATION Oh god let us hope so. No, Muslims should get the hell out Just hope my god is not your god I hope you're just a troll, because if you're sincere you make me ashamed to be Jewish. Yeah, he killed a bunch of antisemitic pre-terrorists at the annual PLO-Norway tettorist Jamboree.  No Apologies If you feel ashamed by what another Jew does, you are doing it wrong. ah, just a troll then. Good good. I am not trolling at all.  There will be no peace until we send these people packing Whevs, troll. WW2 ended with the fully merited expulsion of 12 million germans from Czechia and Poland, followed by 50 years of peace I'm not listening to a word you say. That's what you need to understand. Why on earth would I, given where you started? if you genuinely want to engage with people you need to go about it differently. for now, I assume all you want is to cause upset and anger. That's trolling in my book. You need to earn people's attention, not demand it by attacking them. Good luck. no-one owes you the right to listen, least of all me. Bye bye. I'm going to continue judging you as dangerous and wrong. So aggrieved by the truth on twitter bye imma make some Rachel Corrie pancakes for breakfast at the. classic troll response. And I'm not aggrieved at all. I'm dismissing you out of hand. Different. :) Why is it nice? If I were trolling, and I am not, receiving an 8 part lecture would be a victory well done then. You've won. Good for you. It doesn't matter to me what you think one bit. :) it's a victory to prove you have nothing of value to say is it? Good for you. xxxxxxxxxxx Leave me alone if you are all mad, but I am not letting you get the last word I honestly don't understand why you people do it. What do you hope to achieve? Other than me thinking you're a waste of space? just to hurt someone a bit for a laugh, maybe? Well done you. Hopefully a Muslim.  It is shock therapy. ha! You big hypocrite. As if that's what matters here. well, what if I block you? That's what trolls like isn't it? Then you can go off feeling like you've achieved something of value. FFS. Idk Lets Be Friends Instead! but take this with you: you are doing nothing but damage. Like I said, trolling. Pathetic and irresponsible. I hate muslims and hope they go back go the planet tatooine I really meant it when I said I've written you off. It just upsets me that you have Jew in your name because you don't deserve it. but hey, that's trolls for you. They find a way to destroy what you love. why are you tweeting me, unless to get me to block you? Like I said, trolling. Meaningless words. You don't know anything about being Jewish No, you keep making my fucking cellphone beep troll Troll No more questions, All Said.You clearly in Moron. that is one thing which, as a very clear matter of fact, is untrue. sarcasm Certainly makes more sense than a ""libertarian"" advocating top-down/governmental action. which libertarian is doing that? in what context? Didn't know journalists killed them. Thanks for head- oh wait you're a shit. None that I know of. That would be nonsense. what are you trying to say? police action is arguably top down, thats the appropriate response to this crime BTW it does look as though I was right. You want to justify the killing as if the journalists killed muslims. do I? can you support that defamation with evidence? Ah, I now understand your ""group responsibility"" tweet (I think). A good point. cheers. Times like this when libertarians distinguish themselves fm bigots. the reason you can't find evidence is that your statement was a complete and brainless lie You're the one trying to justify an attack like this by putting one group in a muh victim spotlight. you won't find anywhere that I've done that. You are just making it up and lying about me. please explain. you are exposing you're state of mind, not mine. Ad hominem won't safe you now. You wanted proof. and I'm still waiting for it. (wasn't the ad hom. attack yours?) I just showed you the picture where you tried to use some sort of victim complex. But whatever. but I didn't do that either. Then what were you trying to say with the tweet? Let me give you have clue, do you think brainless violence justified more brainless violence? No. Do you think one leads to the other? then how can I possibly have been""justifying"" the attack? It just seems you were trying to give a reason for the attacks. so you withdraw your lie that I was ""justifying"" or in anyway supporting the attack. Maybe justifying was indeed the wrong word. Trying to reason the attack is what I meant. They were probably angry Muslims.Unfortunately the threat has been for years But no one knew the time of the tweet, as are you aware. There was a good idea from the beginning, from what I understand.Anyway, it's a depressing fact that this was just a matter of time. I think it's the Jedi- that darned Force again....or it could be Mossad...or Area 51.. Try Martians! Now the Middle East will go.into denial mode. Will blame Jewish conspiracy. I slipped the other day and hurt myself......I had no option but to blame the Jews. you are a genuine fuckhead. Go back to posting photos about how you changed the colour of your cocksucking lips that is literally the least intimidating tweet I've ever read. You'll have to try a LOT harder than that. I'm not trying to intimidate you. Sorry that it's not all about you, I'll try to pout and hopefully that ""intimidates"" you what are you trying to do then? With your ""get off twitter"" stuff? Make a positive contribution to the world? Jeez. Go for it. Unless you're too scared to show your face :-) speaking of positive contribution to the world.....You're clearly in love with muslims and good luck to you supporting terrorism probably 1 or 2 muzzies who wouldn't mind stabbing me for lies I've exposed of theirs. They don't like when facts are leaked You really don't understand do you? It genuinely doesn't matter to me what you say. It's completely meaningless. x they are pretty slippery-those Jews!",0
We strongly condemn the horrible shooting at #CharlieHebdo. We must all stand up for freedom of speech and expression. @Charlie_Hebdo_," We have a smart and knowledgeable prime minister;) Well, nowadays won't be delighted with this. you are confusing  freedom of speech with freedom to offend You are confusing freedom of speech with freedom to offend what to others is inviolable or sacrosanct. CHARLIEHEBDO No, actually he's not. Making fun/satirising myths, fables, ideas, goes with the freedom of speech. If you're offended by something I say, it's really your problem. Thus ""freedom of speach"" Lotta only said the fact.:) and who is the one deciding What is offence and What freedom if speech, you? Not certainly pseudo-cultural or pseudo-intellectual bullism. Who r u, who am I, who r they must nt be above respect. Correct. Bullying shouldn't be approved in the name of freedom of speech. CHARLIEHEBDO did wrong too. He is, unfortunately. Bullying shouldn't be accepted in the name of freedom of speech. CHARLIEHEBDO Bullying??? The whole world should stop questioning (religious) ideas, coz 20% of the people might get offended? I take offence how the Muslims treat women and minorities, yet they are free to preach about it-&gt; freedom of speech it's a sign of a civilised country that you can make fun of anyone. Incl. leaders &amp; certainly imaginary beings Making fun / questioning, and being excessively vulgar, disrespectful and rude, are two completely different things. Pointing out those things, is naturally ok. Involving obscene blasphemy and grossness, is not. Not in my / most of the civilised worlds book. Offence can not be given, it can only be taken. Blasphemy!? A law that an omnipotent, omniscient being wont get his feelings hurt. What a joke!! :-D Exactly, I just point them out, don't go shooting people. That magazine satirised every major religion and world leader, yet only one of those groups murdered 13 people. Stop for a second and think. Since there's no law against what they did, you're saying it was ok to kill them? They were even accused of anti-Semitism coz they made fun of Jews. I'm sure the Muslims laughed at those pictures. Islam forbids one to draw Muhammad. Fine. The people doing the drawing weren't Muslims, so the rule doesn't apply. If this Allan akubar exists, those cartoonist would suffer forever after their NATURAL death. That knowledge should be enough. No, a law, that majority of people (and all existing cultures), would have right to have smt sacred still. Yup, but these IMMORAL ""artists"" at CHARLIEHEBDO, did much worse things without any taste or limits. Sure, they can not be killed multiple times. But it's true, there is aggression problem in extreme jihadists. Some douchebag might have laughed, doesn't make the pictures right then again. Heh, maybe you have to stop now. Where did I say anything like it was ok to kill them? I'm not speaking about that. I'm speaking, that it has nothing to do with freedom of speech, but severe bullyism. Here you're partly right, and defo it was INCORRECT to kill anyone, but to accept what they draw and martyring them, is wrong too. But since it's a different thing to different people, we'll end up in a society that can't ridicule anything. ""If you don't want your beliefs to be ridiculed, don't have such ridiculous beliefs"" - someone We'll end up with this. One of most important things humans have in common is: difference! Learn to respect that above unilateral emancipation. H√∂psis. There should be limits to everything, also to restrictions, but have respect and understanding towards others. Prove to me your version of god exists and he's worth worshipping and then I'll consider not ridiculing him/her/it If it truly was a RELIGIONOFPEACE wouldn't their extremists be extremely peaceful? ISLAM That's not the point, but to respect (also) those who have something sacred in their lives. You can ridicule theories. In this case not, because of INGNORANCE. Holy war actually means war against the enemies of ones SOUL. ""aggression problem"" That's quite an understatement, but yes, yes there is. I'd bet quite a few ""douchebags"" laughed. That makes it hypocrisy. And still they are just cartoons. You can express it better ‚Äì no means to understate, but it's not the core of ISLAM nor of the message of the Prophet. If your faith/religion is so weak that it can't handle cartoons, no matter what they depict, not much of a religion Well you can bet and you may be right, but the laughers are fools too, as are the drawers, who crossed many limits. You mean people like this? Well the reactions of course vary, only a fool rages, but it still doesn't make severe disrespect correct. No, he's much worse than a douchebag. By the way, that's a police officer they're executing.And a Muslim. I know. Tragical, but doesn't make much difference which profession/religion he/she has in this case. You didn't, there's a question mark. There are laws against spewing shit about people, doesn't apply to sky fairies If you don't want FREEDOMOFSPEECH to include ridiculing beliefs there are 2 things you can do. 1. Move to a -&gt; &gt; country that doesn't have it. There's plenty to choose from. Or. 2. Try to change things democratically. I'll -&gt; &gt;just say it's a sad day when that happens and then we won't have freedom anymore. If they had been doing it only about a single (actual) person the law would have interfered. And rightly so. Bullying a belief? :-D If they had been satirising only Islam/Muslims, I'd kinda see your point. I disagree. And thank goodness, so does most of the civilised world. Sky fairies is your unnecessary rhetorics. For many people some things are sacred, whether you understand it or not. So should a bully have a right to bully his class mate, because of FREEDOMOFSPEECH? It was still completely tasteless and stupid. Now they are dead. Yup, but for someone to whom nothing is sacred, this might be too difficult to understand. Why? Would it make it more right, if Rolle would bully also Niilo and Asko, besides Ismo? Well most haven't (fortunately) seen all the pics, and it's a stupid trend and a rootless ignorance, too. FREEVIETNAM Viva la difference! But my mouth shouldn't be gagged just because of someone's unsubstantiated beliefs on a ""god"" There should be limits to things, but not free speech. Gagged and good-taste-and-respectfulness-expected are two different things. Again and still. People Deserve Respect, Belief Systems/Religion Doessn. So should one be able to bully as much as one wants in school, because of FREEDOMOFSPEECH? Well that's your opinion, and your still in far minority with that ""belief"". LUCKILY If believe something, a cartoon shouldn't be able to shake that belief. Nothing sacred about Mohammad. You might offend something I hold ""sacred"", but I'll fight for your right to say it. So people can stop calling it a RELIGIONOFPEACE. Thanks, I'll tell them. Prove to me a soul exists. Gibberish. Nothing sacred to you, but you fail to understand, that lots of sacred to some others. UNDERSTANDING RESPECT Yet these people follow quran more to the letter than a moderate Muslim. The bible is full of hate too. More so But it seems you haven't anything, and if you did, sincerely, I'd try not to disrespect it. Don't agree. The limits set by Islam? France is not an Islamic country. And once again, saying about an issue, or meaningfully insulting about something, are different things. Why? Did you get it wrong what I meant? And why sarcasm, it's again just proof of weakness. Btw, if you believe in the bible you're going to hell. You called them fools. Google it, if you can't remember your scripture. The proof is inside of our selves, and only there. Prove it to your self and stop being childish. You'd enjoy it. MOHAMMAD didn't write QURAN, CHRIST didn't write BIBLE.ISLAMCHRISTIANITYDOGMASIGNORANCE Apropos of nothing, at this moment a writer is receiving the first 40 of 1000 lashes in Saudi Arabia for blasphemy. The limits are set by the common sense of the wise. Or actually correction here; they are set by Someone else, but can be understood by those wise who have common sense. Lol, why would I be that interested what the bible says? :D That's not good, that's wrong, and can be ridiculed. Like I said, thankfully disrespect is still included in the freedom of speech. And it ought to be. Disrespect of an idea, a belief. There's a huge difference with disrespecting humans. These things are international and crossing borders anyway. They are actually UNIVERSAL, but let's stick to earth ;) But it's wrong. Why would it ought to be? Agreed. Much worse than anything anyone ever drew on paper. Yet he/she can express her/his feelings. How? Why wouldn't for someone spiritual, a belief be more important, than for example looks or other shallow things? No, because he's dead. Killed by another Muslim. Guess they'll meet in paradise, huh? There's nothing to understand. Just unsubstantiated claims. If 1 is offended by my views, it's her/his problem. Mute me on twitter. Doesn't give you a right to kill me though. But will have to (hopefully) pay it for society, and anyway for his/hers Maker and CONSCIENCE. You're the only one claiming the cartoons were ""bullying"". They are not. Surely not. That's your belief, for which you have freedom, though it might be silly. Sure, there are scales and limits. CHARLIEHEBDO crossed many, but of course doesn't justify killings. Really? I'm the only one? HMMMMMMMMMMMM Tasteless? Stupid? Depends who u ask. But they certainly had the right to say it.Yes they are dead, murdered by theists. So if a bully bullies also others, anyone shouldn't feel offended? ""Certainly had the right""... well, according to you and some others, yes, then again according to some others, not. Never said that. Just coz I see through the bull shit that is religion, doesn't mean that. Unless Niilo, Asko and Ismo are belief systems, I don't see the comparison. Besides, you're still the only one calling what they did ""bullying"" You'll see, easily, if you want. It's about hurting someones deep feelings and important sacred things. I might not know better word, but could write about it more than 140 letters easily. And only one? Knowledge? I'm a non religious too &amp; also convinced that religion is bullshit, but people that belong to it aren't full of shit. Never heard of Charlie hebdo before, now you can not see those pictures. So that worked well. Seen quite a few. Not to me. Like I said, people deserve respect, ideas don't. I wonder who's doing this and if the people in the market drew a picture? Again, you're the one calling it bullying. And those students are people, not ideas. And if they say something, -&gt; &gt;to authorities, something will be done. CHARLIEHEBDO not bullying though, only in your mind. Seems that in you mr.Tuo/mio (yours/mine), you are more mine. I'll leave u 2 gentlemen go on. Markus nice to meet you. In the civilised world? Can you show me some statistics? Nice assumption. Let's say I hold the equality of all humans, men, women, LGBT sacred. Most religions are against that. -&gt; &gt;will you defends me like this when I shoot as many theists as I possibly can? HYPOTHETICALSITUATION But if you did disrespect it, I'd defend your right to say how you feel about it. Yes, it's true, everybody lost. Satire is probably the oldest for of ridiculing the powers that be. Nothing someone says gives the ""butt hurt"" a right to kill. No, I understood perfectly. Thanks. Well ""civilized"" can be seen in far different ways. For me middle class Indian is 100 times more civilized than mid-class american. Prove a negative? Prove something there's no proof of, doesn't exist? Prove to me unicorns don't exist. Didd I think? :-D :-D So you ARE a comedian. You hold it a human right, not a sacred thing. The other things has roots in centuries and millenniums back. Again, why should I live by the rules someone randomly thinks of? The law I get, it's thought of and mostly agreed on. The funny thing is (or actually sad), that you still fail to see that I'm not defending anyon, just condemning CHARLIEHEBDO, too. Don't know, hence the word ""if"". But if I did, I'd do wrong, and the correct thing would be to correct me then. Why would anyone be? ""Everyones beliefs"", and the main religions central path, are again those famous TWODIFFERENTTHINGS :-D Double standards much? He did exactly the same thing. Blasphemy. He's not dead though. Yet. Did I ever say, it would give? Are you focusing at all, or maybe drunk? Then your answer was absurd. If a tribe from Papua New Guinea said that's trees, &amp; subsequently paper, is ""sacred"" to them, would you stop wiping your ass? I don't have to. But to have proof and knowledge of the SPIRIT for oneself, is everything. I sincerely recommend. No, why you're asking? :D I actually corrected it. Once we start telling what you can and can't say, we no longer have FREEDOMOFSPEECH That would be a disaster. Well that CHARLIEHEBDO thing should have been outlawed, but yes, if one has common sense, one understands. Yeah, if you don't know, now you know ;) Not many good reasons, though some nice guidelines if one can discriminate. I'm not saying it can't be, but if your beliefs are unsubstantiated, I have the right to ridicule them. Not him/her, the beliefs I meant that this kind of actions can and should be ridiculed, and for about fifth time, I have never justified any killings. How? She's/he's nameless, faceless? ""If"" there isn't a maker, who will she/he be responsible to? Do you seriously this his/her-&gt; Yeah, I can use water for them. &gt; conscience is going to give him/her trouble for that? He/She believes he's/she's right. BELIEF RELIGION So we can bully our class mates now? Why not? He was killed in the line of duty, heroic death. The killer was doing what the quran tells him to do. But for example Christ didn't do wrong, only humans in the name of Him. So ridiculing his character, is tasteless and wrong. If anything, the police is not going to paradise. Yes, it will, no doubt about that, and do not worry my little friend :D No, it's a fact. Give me a single peer reviewed piece of evidence that proves any of the 3000 or so gods. But the QURAN was not written by MUHAMMED, if you can recall a bit backwards. Don't believe everything what quran says, and especially, don't believe everything you read from the INTERNET.FREEADVICE Even though it's actually not a belief, you call call it silly all you want. Because of FREEDOMOFSPEECH Show me a law that says they crossed a limit. It's not a fact, but your belief. The only proof is inside of your soul, and only you can find it, no-one will find it for you. Sure. On the other hand, I'm also right. First one I've talked to. Why the sarcasm? It makes you look weak. Same thing, if you search it deep enough from inside your soul, you'll easily understand. But okay; would Mandela agree with those? Wow, you got to use the word ""bully"" twice in this tweet. NOTEVENBULLYING There's scales and limits in sarcasm, too. This your post has more sarcasm, than the mine you're answering, don't you think? Yeah, and you're being sarcastic two messages in a row and avoiding the point with it completely! But will you be able to answer this, or? And according to the law, yes. :-) No, I don't see the point in your faulty ""school ground bullying"" analogy. No one should be silenced in case they might hurt someones ""important sacred"" thingies. Ok, only one I've seen so far. Never said they are. People deserve respect. Myths, fables and imaginary beings don't. Well maybe not 100 times, but more civilised absolutely. The U.S. is not on MY civilised countries list. Most of it anyway. Are you saying it can't be sacred to me? Things evolve, we should too. A book written by people who didn't know what stars were&gt; &gt;shouldn't be considered ""sacred"" anymore. I get that, but condemning the victim in this case is to me almost as bad. Who are you to condemn them anyway? They broke no law Maybe french laws, which is stupid, from FRANCE. CHARLIEHEBDO Why not, it's ""freedom of speech"" to say what one wants, isn't it? If you broke a law, yes. I wouldn't argue your right to say it though. That's again your belief/opinion. Can you see there's starting to be repetition pattern here? ----- the point ----&gt;You. It's not about the books, it's about God, and in the end, it doesn't make much difference to know the stars, but to know one self. You are claiming I should respect all people and their beliefs. I'm saying no, I don't. The Klan believes things too. They are victim for the shootings, but wrong doers in the big picture. Along with other extremists, of course. Yes, you see the man made laws, not the Divine laws nor even ""laws of nature"". No you didn't. I said how I feel about the subject.Do you mean concentrating?Sadly, no I'm not :-( Not sure what you're meaning here, please explain, got curious. :-D We shouldn't accept nor respect wrong or wrong doings, but no reason to insult for example Christ or Muhammed. They did no wrong. No you don't &amp; you can't. Just like I don't have to believe in your ""soul"" coz you can't prove it. Again, just your beliefs. You can believe in this ""spirit"" mumbo jumbo and I can ridicule it. Coz you tweeted all of a sudden this general knowledge tidbit and I was wondering if I had anything to do with this brain fart. Ah :-( So you aren't :-/ Certainly, but you can give it a chance; find it and realize it, so you don't have to believe, you'll just comfortably know. So that's ""common sense"" as you define it. Riiiiight Sure, but the happy thing for me is that I don't have to believe in it, I just know it. LUCKY &amp; BLESSED Good to know. Yup, you had, as you suddenly started brain farting some stuff about some books, and it even lasted some time. Discriminate??? Do you mean cherry pick? Sure I am, but also a philosopher. It was poorly expressed earlier. One should find the ""rules"" from one's heart, then common sense occurs. Not from mind, but heart. :-D Sure you would! What if you're in a public toilet and there's no water in the booth? Of course, who would blindly accept anything, especially dogmas. Really, you should stop with this analogy. It makes no sense. There's probably leafs or someones shirt nearby for help. If someone is attacking beliefs, he has the right to do so. If he's attacking a person, he doesn't. No it doesn't, it's a ""freedom of speech"", according to JESUISCHARLIE -people. Well, if Christ and god are the same thing, as many believe, he did plenty wrong. How many times you want to repeat that low-level belief of yours? Christ is a son of God, as many believes, but lets not get into that, as you don't believe it. Besides, Christ is not the belief system. A Christian god is and according to the bible he's an asshole. I really don't think it will. I doubt he/she believes in your ""spirit"". Worry? Me? Hah. Again, where did I say it was? Or is this another one of your ""general knowledge tidbits""? Ah, another ""general knowledge tidbit"". I'm starting to enjoy them. So Don't ridicule Christ, ridiculous bible. Tell that to the jihadists. Who are u to tell anyone what to believe from the quran? Don't you respect their beliefs? HYPOCRITE ""Thinking is no means of knowing the absolute truth"" Are you telling me the claims for any god are not unsubstantiated? Go on then, give evidence proving any god. Well it is, as you're still referring to quran as it would mean something in our conversation. Sure, when you learn to use these in practice, you'll enjoy your life more. Like I said, first you have to prove a ""soul"" exists, before you can even advice me what to do with it. Is this ""soul"" business something they tell you in these ""spirit"" classes? No! You're not! TWEETLIKEASIXYEAROLD Hmmm, maybe you ARE a comedian after all. Bed time for me. Will return. Bye for now. :-) No, I don't exactly respect dogmas, but doesn't mean I'd go insulting them. But the point was not to insult Christ/Muhammed/etc... I've already told, that the only proof is inside one's soul. No use repeating these things over and over. Like I've said (probably many times), it cannot be proven, but only to one self. Please stop repeating yourself. No, there's no business and there's no classes. Same Lord, need some drag now. More of this ""soul"" thing, huh? It's all scales and limits with you. Sarcasm is sarcasm, apparently I'm not allowed to do it and you're. -&gt; &gt; but it's ok, we now know you have double standards. HYPOCRITE LIMITSANDSCALESMAN There's no point in your bully nonsense. It's a bad analogy. You bully. SEEIUSEDITTWICETOO So the French law is stupid? :-D Should it be replaced with sharia? NOTACOMEDIAN I don't know what kind of school you went to, but the school bullies I've seen rarely were into ""words"" or arguments. That's why, for the umpteenth time, it's A B-A-D A-N-A-L-O-G-Y My opinion, the opinion of a civilised society and the way the law sees it. BOOM. Sorry. You're free to try and change it, move or live with it. There's no ifs or buts. No ""bullies"". Those are your choices. NOTSORRY Yes I see the repetition. Unfortunately for you, the law agrees with me. Thankfully. Is it? Which god is that. I'm really more interested why the stars are there, than any book of bull shit. And so should anyone living in the 21st century. We're done with myths, time for facts. Again, they broke no law. You didn't answer me, who are you to condemn them, if they broke no law? :-D Stupidest tweet of the day! You want to go with the ""divine"" law? Sharia? Haha Did you read your tweet before pressing send? I did, in my next tweet. Besides I'm still laughing at this gem I didn't say anything about wrong doings. Don't move the goalposts. We've been talking about beliefs the whole time. And you say we should respect everyones beliefs. I gave you an example. The Klan. Should we respect their beliefs? Muhammad was a pedophile. Says so in the quran. :-D ""Did nothing wrong"" haha There, I just gave it chance. No sign of it. You know why? Coz it doesn't exists. Yeah, just like any theist in the world. ""Oh, I just know. He lives in my soul."" :-D Hehe, had to come back to this. Can you see the desperation in your tweet? Clasping for straws much? ""Divine law"" :-D I guess I'm LUCKY &amp; BLESSED coz I see the world as it is. Hit a nerve? You must be good.Now there's some sarcasm for you ;-) Sorry, this is even more stupid than the ""divine law"" tweet. I'm sure the killers searched their ""heart"" and look what happened. :-D Someones shirt? Dude, you need to sacrifice yours I'm afraid. No one's gonna give you their shirt at that point. U said I don't hold anything sacred &amp; I said I do. You know what it is? Paper. Better to keep an extra shirt with u from now on. I mean, you don't want to disrespect my beliefs do you? I didn't forbid you to use it. I said it's a bad analogy, which it is. As many as I need to. How many times are you gonna mention this non-existent soul? Yes, but many denominations of Christianity believe that god, christ, holy spirit all same thing, god. GENERALKNOWLEDGETIDBIT But the bible is infallible word of god, isn't it? And if j√©sus = god, the bible proves he's an asshole. So the quran had nothing to do with the mindset of the killers? Ah, so you're an apologist. Makes sense. Please, stop with the condescending bull shit. You know nothing of me or what I enjoy. SPIRITGUIDE You just contradicted yourself. No use repeating this ""soul"" BS without proof. So you're a ""do as I say, don't do as I do"" -type of guy, huh? Repeating myself? You keep bringing up this non-existent ""soul"". So what's the con then??? Sorry to come back to this, but have you read Deuteronomy and Leviticus? These are the laws you respect? Or sharia? If the actions of the cartoonists were lawful (and they were), -&gt; &gt; discussing the content of the cartoons is a lot like discussing what the woman was wearing when she got raped. Ok. I think we're done here anyway. I will read your tweets and think about them, but won't comment any further. -&gt; &gt; I think everything's been said and maybe a bit more. I also think it's clear neither of us will change their mind. I'll finish with these quotes from the very smart Have a good one. Well alcoholics who choose welfare and prostitutes and school bullies might not brake law ‚Äì I still not approve their doings. No, I thought you're smarter than that, I underestimated you, sorry. Forget the ""Divine"" then, just focus on the nature/natural. No, you have been talking about beliefs, not me. Take your narcissistic head out of your arse and see the outside for a while. You forgot the consept ""sincerety"". Must be difficult. I don't need to guess, but descending for these conversations after your low blows makes me feel bit silly that's true. Not at all. What happened in between the break, I feel you're getting more lower and lack any kind of essence from your posts? Yes, rudeness is weak mans imitation of strentgh. Well it's stupid for those who won't get it. I told you, I underestimated you. Forget fairies, think Mandela or Gandhi then. And no they didn't. One could say ""heart full of anger"", but digging deep and searching the essence will cleanse it. You reall continue even with this? No it isn't, I should have known better; you're just one more christian atheist dissapointed. Probably it did, but Mohammad didn't write it. So ridicule bible and quran, not Christ nor Mohammad. That's my point all over. I know a lot already from this conversation, but what prevents you of stopping? No I Didn't, you just won it. Another completely failed CIRCULARARGUMENT. Have could I prove you that love, other emotions or for example mind exists? Silly argument. But I answered to this already with the alcoholic welfare guy- / prostitue- / school bully example. This is not needed. I'm not anyhow justifying the terror attacks and the deaths, just not accepting the martyrism or heroism -‚Ä∫ -‚Ä∫ of theirs, and saying that their ""art"" was (at least partly) discusting, immoral, not needed, uncalled, non beneficial -‚Ä∫ -‚Ä∫ and what it came to some of the worst ones: extremely insulting and obscenely ugly. And he seems to be far from smart, when Some who are considered holy and widely loved, can be insulted like that.",0
The right 2 draw Muhammad without being shot is as precious to many of us as Muhammad is to the #CharlieHebdo killers http://t.co/QeDw4tRoK9," This is an assumption. Cui bono? Tom Cui bono?  In this case M le Pen. Nov 2014 I was sent home by BCBS MI, paraplegic with no family. BCBS MI solution? File for Medicaid. What's Medicaid! HELP! the attack is horrible, but this is misogyny + racism Let's see how many broadcasters have the balls to show the cartoon on TV. FATCHANCE no, it isn't. plainly. Taliban,Boko haram,Alqaida &amp; ISIS r terrorists but those who mock my prophet (PBUH) and my religion theyRalso terrorists Yes. Islam is a barbaric political death cult and should be banned from planet earth. it most surely is. Now what has that to do with the freedom of speech statement you were responding to? Not really. Not in the going-around-killing-people sense of 'terrorist'. RIGHT to draw Mohammed ?? No, they aren't. One must suspect you don't understand the meaning of the word ""terrorist"". Islam cannot co-exist with any other religion.It is totally intolerant yet DEMANDS tolerance! don't be ridiculous, 'mocking' is not a terrorist action may innocents rest in peace. mock me my love ones but not my prophet (peace be upon him) never ever ever. it's very complicated how above mentioned racist misogyny is protected by white freedom of speech ""white freedom of speech""? Seriously? I hate almost any CH's strip I've seen. Does it matter? white privilege / white gaze  are systemic and are beyond your choice, you didn't choose to be born white white/capitalist privilege has little to do with the freedom to make fun of a religion. Indeed. Unless you're saying that the victims of today's attack weren't innocent? off course they were innocents. Killing an innocent is like killing humanity. considering it's a first terrorist act in France since war, while brown and black people keep dying? We have freedom of speech and mockery is not terrorism. Please tell me you're not really a solicitor?! I think you really need to mug up a bit on your post-War French history. Agreed! Much love to you today. Much love to us all. im a practising criminal lawyer to b honest ;) That is extremely concerning really? more atheist French people died then peaceful Muslim people in last 10 years? today's victims were innocent indeed. RIP oday's victims were innocent indeed. RIP Any attack on freedom of speech is unjustificable - and can't be justified by the evils of capitalism. You're right, details aren't in yet on the attack. Thanks! It's not the first terrorist attack in France since the War. this is not part of the war in Middle East. It's religion fanatism and it's not exclusively islamic. any murder is unjustifiable, but there is epidemic of male violence (incl suicide) S it's ok to shoot dead 12 people for drawing a cartoon is it? no it's a nightmare. They were innocent. RIP mohammad himself started his beginning by mocking pagan religion, don't bullshit dumbfuck So you think this killing was justified?!? never ner here is COE calling it worst in 40 years, compare to Assad none of that is real. You're just a racist like most people. this white man Found France and Inida among most racists India then Arabia. So like half the world is racist. and you focus on white people. u racist. Any ideoligy where there is an element of conversion/missionary is problematic. bc whites and arabs profited from slavery     SUSPECTEDLOOTERS very true! Quite. The War ended 70 years ago. Name a culture that doesn't have a history of slavery. Just admit you are racist. u cant win Also Africans enslaved each other. And sold slaves to whites. Don't be naive. compare to Assad who killed 150x more civilians than ISIS some African mothers insist on female genital mutilation, doesn't prove they profit fr it thats So what. That doesn't disprove anything. You're a racist by definition. Annoyingly. btw Michael Jackson was an internal racist too, had to change race to white, it's global Whats your point. That ""white people are bad"". Thats typical racism. Its low tier thinking. no, white people are rich and educated (good) but deny their privildege of white supremacy If white people are privileged then you're admitting they were better than everyone else. on contrary, skin color doesn't define intelligence so then how are white people privileged no idea why I am tagged into this but can it please stop? you don't have to even answer the people who have zero IQ.",0
"Quran says: Whoever kills an innocent soul.. it is as if they had killed the entire humanity.
#CharlieHebdo #Paris http://t.co/UinZ805MpA"," Well, just convince yourself those souls ain't innocent. Makes the killing just again... Only sick people would do that. Unfortunately, those are the idiots that get publicized. This violence imo is just as inherent to any religion as acts of charity are. History is proof of that problem is what the Quran also says about those who insult Allah and the prophet. No it doesnt. Go read a translated version of the Quran. See for yourself exactly what it teaches. You've nothing to lose I've done so, multiple times, it's so double. Parts are beautiful, others well, are not. Will look into it when home. Thank you. Appreciate it. it also says ""Kill those who insult islam "" Qur'an (33:61)  CHARLIEHEBDO Loved your PARIS Post hy Not post on  Proximity Based Travel Network? Actually: Accursed wherever they are found, being seized &amp; massacred completely.And please don't take verses out of context. accursed &amp; massacred ( with a Kalashnikov. ) exactly what they did. Please read the verses before and after and not take one single verse out of context. Thank you for your understanding. they'll say those killed weren't innocent; whereas the Bible says unconditionnally: you shall not kill the counter argument is trivial: they insulted the prophet, so they are not innocent DUH Then these chaps should learn to read it. Are they viewed as heretics by Muslims then? They are by many followers of Islam - The BBC etc. don't give them publicity either. Easier to demonise for ConUKIP That's a bad translation from Hebrew. It's thou shalt not murder. doesn't change the problem of unconditionnality better said bro Let me put it this way if all Muslims thought the way those people did we'd have a billion terrorists. Majority are? My pleasure.. Even though you're a Chelsea supporter lol Unfortunatelly Islam has the same problem as the West many with little understanding being manipulated by evil men. So what is the answer to my question. Are these killers regarded as heroes or villains by the Muslim in the street? It's those who are angry, frustrated, hopeless &amp; lost who are easily manipulated. Oh definitely villains. Outcasts make the best followers. Look at Robin Hood and Hitler In the same way as it has become common in the USA to say 'thank you for your service' it varies greatly. given the magazines bullying of the prophet, I suspect most moderates while against are less sympathetic When the main source of education can be taken over by militants who corrupt text...... But who dare criticise a man with a gun. If it is Che or Mao or Hitler or a Muslim extremist. So the violent win? Easy to do to those who live in hell on earth. We can blame that, in part, to political exploitation. I'm moderate.. I think. We follow different rules an Laws relating to behaviour Bullying!!! He's been dead a long time you know Monkey trial? I once had a long chat with an Irish Catholic Priest at the height of the troubles - He condemned the IRA. Same thing But in public? At the pulpit? There is no death...proper end of death...remember. A magazine dedicated to ridiculing your nan in heaven You don't know? this is not justification by the way. My teaching would always be laugh or ignore. Both - a man I respected The perception of others is often different to our own Laughing at inconsistancy is one of the most effectivel ways of opening a closed mind to reason. Im a devout human securalist by the way. Lets look out for each other in this brief existance, No. You and I differ on this completely. How can any sane person condone this outrage. Or sympathise!! Or Getting Shot It is not condoning to try to understand. OK. Explain it to me. Appeasement got us nowhere in the 30's trying to understand Hitler's viewpoint I thought the same way until I listened to a Palestinian in the 1970s. To understand is not to agree. Would mist eat free range lamb ever again if THEY had to kill it themselves from now? Perception. Don't see the relevence To understand ones enemy does not make him your friend I'm saying that most of us are irresponsible We are complicit, and work tax fund acts we find abohrant. To an outsider how would we look. And we are the few fighting for peace online. How? is someone who murders a random person worse than one murdering somone who repeatedly insulted their nan? Both terrible. I'd say one less so. BUT if we had tried to understand the reasons the German People were able to be manipulated by Hitler? Odd comparison. But this is not a Nan but a long dead prophet. So what view of Life of Brian? Treaty of Versailles? He did win an election after all. So same outcome? The winning of an election is debatable but historic - same reasons as UKIP supporters Can't quite see Farage gunning down Ian Hislop Typical posh boy all wind no water. But does he carry a gun? Did I notice a bulge in his trousers while he was talking to George? The pakistani children we drone strike with macro economic regard for life will place same value on it. AKA Water. Mae West is all I have to say on that joke I have real doubts about him being human &amp; being some sort of cartoon character controlled by Cameron I remember the USA shelling the Beruit Camps - crazy people who 'took vengance' for others acts - it just goes on I think he the bad cop in part of a uk establishment grand plan to renegotiate EU but stay in. That is possible - I have believed nothing any of them say about EU since Labour turned total pro EU Murder is murder. They are as bad as each other. the the uk drone pilot who killled school kids, if working you part funded it. All same? yes they are Murder is Murder .... and what should the punishment for murder be? That is not up to me. And who was the punishment taken out on? Was it the drone pilots punished? or someone random? random violence begetting random violence = escelation of violence and as ghandi said, ""an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind"" And at the oposite end we should have left Poland to it's fate and left Hitler alone? Well it was hitler and his followers who did evil, and they alone who should be punished as it was... and it was done to protect their victims, not to avenge So it is only the 'controlling minds' not just those following orders? ""and his followers"" But what of someone who has done neither? what if they just happen to live the same The trial of Lord HawHaw (sp) negates the protection argument. haha thanks brother. I respect LFc myself and felt they were very unlucky last season. Don't remind me! Lol sorry to have done that, hope they improve in the league this season üëçüëç I sincerely hope so too üòä thank you.",0
What we know about the gunmen in the #CharlieHebdo attack: http://t.co/z4xLMmeDl5 (Pic: Gelbard/AFP/Getty) http://t.co/KKtg9fGeba," Great shot... Absolute cowards! pixelates the cartoon on cover of CHARLIEHEBDO So much for free press, eh? Western leaders created terrorists with various Arabic ""springs"" by  mercenaries jihadists.It was INEVITABLE to go west. freedom of speech- pathetic. Disgusting cowardice for blurring that cartoon! It means you are part of the problem, this attitude makes you an enabler. Mt. I can't believe you have pixelated Charlie's cover. Sad. This is what it comes to. P Can't blame them today i suppose cc Why do you pixel the images of CHARLIEHEBDO. Are you afraid of terrorists? This is not the right way of facing this problem... The are using a dead cop photo on their website ! So.This is where we tell ourselves that is necessary. And I always thought the Brits had more balls than that. and then they say the French are cowards... Muslims do not believe in any form of freedom, Disgusting.Cowards !! Unblur the picture you chicken shits I know every one that I have met has had guts to spare. Apparently traded theirs off. Œ§he is relatively benign the is even worse the wording in their news bulletins drips cowardice! Pixellating something that people may find offensive isn't cowardly or anti-freedom of speech. If we start to be scared we are lost. We must stand for freedom of expression seriously?! You didn't quite get it I think... thanks for sharing. Shame on you did the Telegraph tweet that today? how dare u ! FREEDOMOFSPEECH As journalists u should support CHALIEHEBDO and pay respect to thevictims , This isn't true and u shouldn't generalize. We have extremist as in any religion. I don't see Muslims demonstrating against terrorism, but they did about a film! In addition, our religion prohibits us from killing and asked us to discuss ideas by ideas-cont. &amp;not to return back insults. Freedom doesn't mean insulting other religions and believes-cont. I'm totally against terrorizing &amp;killing people for their ideas &amp;the same goes to all Muslims. Although i'm totally against what they published but i'm shocked that people has been killed for expressing their ideas. RIP all those who died. You're all BS. IS is Muslim - barbaric - in name of Islam. I would reject this type of religion, but u defend it! I'm from Egypt,&amp;u know that we are facing attacks from terrorists so I can understand ur feeling but we demonstrate for freedom in addition, i'm with u in part that Muslims are emotional for any insult to its religion so why others don't respect this. You're telling me what 2 say! FREEDOM OF SPEECH. Nah! 'I'll shoot you if I don't like what u say!' and who told u that ISIS represents Islam. Please if you don't know about something read about it first. Only Muslims have a right 2b sensitive? Go live in a Muslim country. We enjoy FREEDOM in Oz! IS says it represents Islam! It's u who needs 2 read &amp; understand! You have to differentiate between Islam &amp;Extremist. Otherwise we are accusing more than 1.5 Billion or more persons and who told u that we are with killing and shooting? on the contrary, we are aganist this 100% Because this is the most attacked religion. I'm already living in a Muslim country but I respect other religions Now u r telling me what I have 2 do! Do as Muslim says, not as you wish 2!!!!! Democracy? HELL NO!!!! if I come &amp;kill somebody &amp; told u that I represent Jesus would u be convinced? or u will be convienced if u want to That's why innocent people dies? Go play elsewhere u have been brainwashed &amp; can't c reality! Thanks a lot for ur insult. Anyway RIP all those who died and believe what u want to believe. Great so go &amp; preach your BS 2 your followers thnx and nice to tweet with u.",0
"As a Muslim, killing innocent people in the name of Islam is much, much more offensive to me than any cartoon can ever be. #CharlieHebdo"," Mrs. Adam Iyi yes :)) UAE den Kovulmus, Ustelik Liberal?:)) Liberteryan even.He speaks well and very romantic.He thinks everyone like himself :) you really compare a cartoon and a kill ? How do you know the killers are Muslims and they killed in the name of ƒ∞slam? fuck you fucking muslim not all Muslims are terrorists; yet all terrorists are Muslim. Let's not wear blinders today. Innocent? LOL He's saying the reaction is disproportionate to the apparent offending cartoon. He's condemning it. they disrespected islam not once but weekly basis, not sorry for such bastards yeah sorry for police guys ! See that Muslim lady in a Hijab walking down the streets of Minneapolis, Dearborn, Philly, she's to blame. Today is a Day we lose all this BULLSHIT Political Correctness. MUSLIMS attacked Paris. M-U-S-L-I-M a voice of reason please shout it LOUD not all Muslims are terrorists but all terrorists are Muslim Shit be upon any mother fucker American who doesn't identify this as a MUSLIM attack on France. it's all over the news you cretin Sadly, not all will see them as innocent people :-/ freedom of speech you fucking idiot if you don't like it fuck off back to your mud hut Potentially this years most ignorant statement. I sincerely hope it was irony. so the solution is killing? that doesn't mean you kill them? People have freedom of speech, as does the press.. I have no idea what is saying. STFU I am saying Melissa, let's lose the political correctness today. Muslims killed white Westerners That was a really stupid remark This is confirmed on French TV. You can hear the killers scream Allaou Akbar. Well, you got all terrorists Are Muslim. freedom of expression u idiot so fuck off Plus this newspaper has done cartoons about Islam and lived a former attack in 2011. They weren't killed because they were white. Come on. Give me a fuckin' break. Goddamned Melissa. You're better than that. WARONWHITES even the second one is not correct, KKK, Tamil Tigers, Jewish terrorist groups are not Muslims with due respect freedom of speech is not infinite.  French gov better had taken action against them u cannot expect people to stay cool while u keep mocking them Jewish Terrorist groups? Come ON. Had to stretch for the Tamils. No. Islam needs to own this cartoons were drawn in 2011, why are they attacking now? shouting Allah-u akbar is not proof you don't read that much, do you? I was referring to the journalists right to publish a cartoon you wank stain try harder. you missed KKK as well. I don't at all, but killing 11 people? It's a disgrace to Islam.. maybe they're from Venus. they joked at every religion you fucking moron. Only your backwards Fuckers kill because of it. Cunt But if this is convenient for you, yes you can always blame the ""other"" for anything bad yes I was referring to armed chap right to hit trigger now fuck off yeah if u have lost ur honor than others cannot be blamed Islam needs to own nothing. A few people does not include all Muslims. Is this hard to grasp? incorrect. A white man just bombed a NAACP office in Colorado &amp; he's not Muslim I am so sorry about innocents killed in it.not sorry for those who disrespect and agree killing no solution why is it Muslims can openly declare kill kaffir + disrespect other religions but not vice versa We do not know for sure. This is too soon but that grives us an idea... each week this journal kids about every religion... Why now? I cannot say... put on the same scale a kill and a cartoon ? One more offensive than other ? It's crazy. who's the terrorist in the little kids eyes whos parents have been shot by our military? idea, yes, but majority are talking as if they exactly know attackers and their motivations Everyone can be seen as a terrorist depending on where you are in your life what fucking. Honour? It's a daft book about a bloke who married children. Why? If you were so sure about your faith you wouldn't care. Why is religion exempt from criticism? then we are agreed, no one has the right to mock religion, but you cannot kill in the name of religion either no a select few of fucked up people attacked Paris not Muslims fucked up people don't categorize a whole religion because some people are fucked up Hitler was the biggest terrorist EVER and he was Christian so wheres your logic? yes,  there must be limits on freedom of speech. Such mag provoke hate and outcome we witness He is saying it's NOT on the same level. I do not know if you read french but this is what we know. don't dare say so mother fucker your quiet possibly the most ignorant delusional idiot known to man there must be equal respect amd equality because v r humans and have 2 share the earth with diversity it say it's mutch mutch more. Which means it's not on the same level... Quit with the selective understanding everyone is exempt from criticism, what gives anyone the right to publicly mock someone/something? No. Stalin and Mao were atheist and the biggest terrorists. Fucking Retards Religion Everyone should have the right to mock whatever they want. Nobody has the right to take a life. as you whant. lemmi guess u wll nt regret wat u r saying mocking yes is valid but ethics amd limits must be applied people will commit horrendous acts no matter on there religion this very concept is bone of contention and being used to provoke you should have some text interpretation lessons, lad... Hitler didn't kill because of religion. educate urself: so the Nazis never killed 6million people mainly Jews? Absolutely not. It's basic freedom of speech. Which also allows you to argue back. yes they did.. just not in the name of Christianity. 1) it's unconfirmed who the attackers were (there were previous attacks by fascists) 2) Plenty of white people have killed Muslims. 3) ISIS predominantly kills Muslims. idiot I never stated he did because he was Christian but the comment that all terrorists 4) ""White"" is not a homogeneous culture. Neither is Islam. For bigots, yes it seems to be. are Muslim is pure delusional, and Hitler is a good example of it being because he was pure fucked up they obviously do not realise that Islam is 1.7 billion people worldwide you fucking shrimp, fuck off you fat cow Christian group recently demanded that all gays be put to death if you hate on a whole religion for actions of few people then your an idiot Back atcha ya fucking fat pig. Stuff your ass with a pork chop. if religion remained something private (like sexuality) or was not a choice (like race), your point would be more valid I'm sorry, Even then Killing is not justifiable.Killing is never justifiable. todays terrorist is tomorrows freedom fighter... Nelson Mandela ring a bell? AGGREED, BECAUSE YOU HAVE A MUSLIM NAME DOES NOT MAKE YOU A MUSLIM. fuck off you gay ass sucker.: Im gonna shoot you fucking white ass Bring it on.  I'm a Texan and I support my Gun Rights u are absolutely ignorant of importance of religion.  Ur Brian is so small 2 comprehend it you are deranged do u agree that most terrorist acts in recent years are in the name of islam? the majority yes and those responsible are pure scum but think how many Muslims the biggest terrorists the world has ever seen is the US. They kill millions I have seen ignorant people, but hey lets welcome the worst of them there are in this world should we judge them all because of a few those b who provoked it by their work+gov failure to Bridle them are reasons but because there America it's not all in the media and because the media demonize all Muslims nobody cares when they do hear certainly we cannot argue on all fronts of society. Point is limit 2 freedom of speech is vital haha no you're a white pig and you suck your pig ass üòÇ F'ed up people, who happen to be radical Muslims, were attackers. Deal w/ it. I eat pig.  Yum, yum. You don't know what you're missin' fuckin' Muslim slimeball. Shit be upon you. ewwwwww suck a d*ck you punk ass Right you are.  I'm punk ass to the core: Sex Pistols, Ramones, Clash. And no I don't fuck goats, like you Muzzies seem t'enjoy Survey conducted by Pew Research: islam creates violence. not acknowledging it is bad. not all muslims are bad. but unfortunately, many are, and much more are legitmizing it in the community just don't blame the whole religion that's not right you're a good person not wanting to generalize,but this is also a bad approach stay real, millions are being terrorised by islam. and it's GROWING. Ali Gomaa, Egypt grand mufti, highest Muslim religious authority, supports murdering non-Muslims it's growing yes and that's horrible just hopefully it can be stopped soon too much muslim doing shit. too little protests from Muslim on shit they do. She's to Much In daily Al Ahram (07/04/08) - ‚ÄúMuslims must kill non-blvrs wherever they r unless convert to Islam.‚Äù not true, u have wrong information. Egypt homes ancient Christians. Ali Gomaa also compares non-Muslims to apes and pigs. It might be important to you. Fair enough. But it's not to me. It's subjective. My Brian is just fine thanks. Ira? BS, the quran says there shall be no compulsion in religion i don't know this guy nor agree with his ideas nor he authority islam USA is killing too many Muslims everyday all over the world. Have u ever condemmed how would you propose to limit his freedom of speech? Would you issue a fatwa on him? yes with due respect and no harsh feelings.  Peace oh yes, that's another one I couldn't agree more. The Quran also says that all religions shall be respected a terrorist that says differently is lying. yes if he does say that he must be held responsible and how many of these ancient Coptic Christians have been murdered for their religion? yes there is tolerance and right to practice otjrr religion for people of those religions War on whites???! You don't need a break, Eric. You need a mental enema! they shouted allah ackbar STUPIDPIG People got massacred today. Playing the White Supremacy card is utterly moronic. ETA ANY religion that can't roll-on-the-ground laugh at itself needs to completely re-evaluate itself i condemn their killing.  They deserve same right 2 live as others Yes Innocent Al Tantawi, President -Al Azhar Univeristy approves killing &amp; maiming Christians, Jews+other infidels. Now you, so, shouted Allah.Didd IT Maximum Muslim? kindly share source!I never heard such a thing Tantawi ‚ÄúThis not my personal view. Is what Shari‚Äôa Law says,law of Allah, only valid law on earth.‚Äù so much this.  Plus deal with freedom of speech.  Don't like?  Don't read. plz share article or book I must read or ur quoting might be out of context things perhaps work differently in real world! Well said ... plz scholar article.  u r citing is out of context Fundamentalist beliefs are an anachronism in a modern world. They'll disappear in time they didn't shout eee edl. Face facts you pig. everyone can mock religion, for Christ's sake! See, just done it... not realy!anchar if strog can tke world along beter learn 2 respect or lest no disrespet I wish,  but it's not going to be anytime soon.  And not alone.  We need to do something. Agree.Don't criticize me! where does it say that? chapter? verse? hadith? no bro! Mocking religion is against ethics cause hate in socieity mine especially! Ahhh yes. The freedom of speech and expression. Have a Blessed day aamer. but also sometimes because of it. Herein lies the difference i may criticise but sure no disrespect or mocking.u can criticize but in respectable way article of scholar u were referring back provide it will do Mocking religion is dangerous, that's for sure. Why do religious people hate people from other religions/atheist? religion people r at odds with atheists may be Thats Why but hate and disrespect r two different things All very subjective criteria. The bullets shot in the name of Allah were all too real! u answered in previous tweet Is it too much to ask that we lose the Political Correctness for 1 day? It was Muslims Very much so. Fortunately (sort of..), only the religious use guns You can't be serious That's selective understanding in a nutshell! CHARLIEHEBDO is it to much to ask for everyone being valued the same have you mentioned the 38 in Yemen? oh no that's Muslims dead, your logic is basically Muslims being victims of terrorism is acceptable but when it's someone else is the victims you can blame it on Muslims it's a tragedy both events are horrendous and deserve to be executed but not a whole religion You're the hero of the day with this amazing thought. What the fuck is wrong with ppl like U? No mocking nor disrespect intended, but this would also be subjective so I apologize Do you ever think that killing innocent it's offensive ? Or much more offensive than something?Do you? communists were and are not religious.yesterday one blew herself up in Turkey! they just said 'Allah u akbar' Of course its offensive but U don't seem to get his point. He's condemning their actions. Bush&amp;Netenyahu killed millions in the name of Christianism&amp;Judaism.can u blame religious&amp;believers Yep. Attacking police, while not right, feels more like a fight than shooting civilians cartoonists somehow I do not think kill people it's offensive, I think it's a crime vs people and all Goods. first of all im not american, and secondly do you have a problem with christianism ? You are a disgrace to the founding principles of your country Yes it's a crime. But when it's done like this it's an act of terror. Again, what's your point? Why do Muslims want 2 live in dissolute places like France/UK/USA/Canada? Please explain. not that many. &amp; not that innocent. &amp; YES, I condemned! but not for fact they were musl I condemn not just USA, any gov's recklessness in being involved in killing innocent. they should have shouted ALLAHDOESNOTEXIST Your PROPHET himself was a monster you cretin! but that ideology that you defend so BLINDLY is just disgusting. It isnt just a few people: Islamic nations still execute for blasphemy etc. Yeah, and entire countries which execute for blasphemy. Islam is Muhammad, and Muhammad is a CUNT. I don't live in West ask any Muslim out there. There are alot ofnur creed converted too ask them that ideology, that religion, requiring you to murder, allowing you theft and rape.. for mare fact that you are muslim, and the other is not, is disgusting. Why ISIS still consider themselves religious? Read here: yeah police officers innocents cartoonist did provoke and disrespected religion responsible for their acts I've read the quran. It is not the word of God, it is a hate document. Fuck Islam with a million pig penises, FUCK IT!!! So familyguy made fun or jesus and his 'magic' we should start killing them over a funny cartoon üòÇ? your ideology is just too sick.. since they b were not family guys not applicable in above clause Murat, you are allowed to steal from non muslim. You will still go to heaven. Murat, you are allowed and rewarded for killing non Muslim. You'll go to heaven for it Religion is an absolute waste or time, theres no such thing as any god üòÇ ""My prophet?"". You have no idea what u r talking about. but nice try to show your bigotry Murat it's ok for you to rape non Muslim. You are allowed. You are rehearsing Judaism's tenets, not Islam. You seemed to ignorant about topic Its like a cartoon making fun of scottish people and me going down killing them in the name of william wallace üòÇüòÇ Utterly stupid might be for u but this belief does not give u right to disrespect it for those who believe in it And your type of ignorance is no different from Jihadist types. two sides of the same coin AND u r confusing Islamists with Muslims. Now go try to learn some facts. So im not aloud to disrespect a bunch of crazy people who murdered people doing a funny job üòÇ Saudi cleric confirms your prophet was phedophile &amp;rapist. but you'd still kill for him which Judaism tenets do I rehearse? that was Saudi assertion.. Then I wonder when extreme Jews or Christians are gonna attack. Hmmm. NEVER? Murat you had no choice to be Muslim. you were told to be one. you are forced to be one. you are victim. &amp; u are stuck in there. coz deep down u still think u have no choice. and muslims a disgrace of humanity??? You can't accuse all Muslims of being terrorists. you can't say kill people it's offensive, it's not enough, you can't compare this act to a cartoon. But you can't kill people for publishing a cartoon. Get over it. A delightful tweet to a Muslim who CONDEMNS the CHARLIEHEBDO attacks. Your idea of expression is a bit worse! Serious problem with your reading? I don't compare, neither does  he! He's telling us that it's wrong! Unfortunately incidents like this not only result in senseless slaughter, but also spark sweeping anti-religious sentiment. You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Do you actually know any Muslims? There are extremes on both sides &amp; both are extremely harmful. Don't understand why it's so hard to take a logical view :/ I never got a muslim name you a muslim?üòÇ__ Are you defending these animals? Why is Islam overflowing with murderers? Aka, condemning violence in the strongest terms, wherever its source, but not blaming billions of innocent people of faith. Indeed. I'm as vocal on religion as any ardent atheist, but if people can't distinguish between Muslim and Islamic terrorist.. You do have a point there. nutcases who'd oppress their own people to stuff their ideology down everyone's throats, they need a reality check. So, opposing an irrational death cult is as bad as the death cult it opposes? Eat shit and die. Some Folks Can't Tell Unequivocal Condemnation. yes u never said that. Name does not make u Muslim or Christian ur faith does Nobody is animal here. And I am defending innocent people not these terrorists it doesn't, I'm atheist, but I wouldn't mock religion, it's just basic respect, disgusting.. Islam is bigotry. By the way, you are an insufferable cunt who fully deserves Sharia. if ubr arthiest i dont mock u either.there is respect and no thing disgusting Name all the people I've killed in the name of my 'bigotry' then, scumbag. lol ""Islamist"" is a meaningless term, nothing but a rhetorical bluster! I hope cancer eats your bones. Here's a FACT: the Quran says the sun orbits earth. Here's another: it doesn't!! if you are Muslim, it makes you shout Allahu akbar .. &lt; what a cunt, I can only hope and pray that a painful cancerous death awaits him. this shows how rerated he is. Ignorance is a disease. I mean mocking religion is disgusting.. But killing people in the name of religion is worse.. I do Agree but we must make sure no Provoking 2 Heat up AMD Get worse in Killing s all terrorists are Muslim? IRA? ETA? Bader meinhoff?  Well youLearn something every day. IRA and ETA laid down arms long ago. And they were trying to change THEIR country NOT every fucker else's I'm talking about TODAY you cretinous wank stain you forgot to mention Guy Fawkes IDIOT Graham, you should explain yourself better you monkey hanging useless cunt. hahaha a wank sock trying to be humerous FAIL we only hung it because it looked like your mam Do you see Jews raping children? Beheadings in Vatican City? Sorry, pal.  The practitioners of your ""religion"" are animals. No they simply slaughter. Does that make terrorism no terrorism? Do you, personally, feel people should be killed for leaving Islam? Because a third of your fellows do. evidence? dude, ask a muslim I am not one In that cqse you are a pseudo-liberal appeaser of Islam, which is worse. Amir, are you a supporter of genital mutilation? Child rape? Go back to ur old school and kick your English teacher's ass. They failed you horribly. That some madmen use Islam ... What can Muslims pacifist do there? how eloquently put! Your Mother would be proud of you. ira laid weapons down? Officially maybe. They both still exist though. wanksock? From Newcastle you Boro wannabe tosser What difference does it make? They obviously felt what they did was making a religious statement. Boro ?? hahaha you really are a cretin aren't you and YES you are a wank sock you idiotic Geordie arsehole yes they exist but my point was EVERY terrorist outrage carried out today is perpetrated by Muslims You never got today.At work. he's saying it's wrong. They killed because of an offensive cartoon. He said kill is worse. People who are so afraid of a pen that they have to kill, deserve the contempt of all civilized humanity Maybe if the west stopped trying to change the countries in the M.E the people wouldn't try and ""change"" this country The terrorist Anders Breivik killed 78 people in Norway. Not a Muslim. Keep to facts please. he killed to raise a point about Muslims in Norway read his court statement you imbecile maybe the Middle East should leave the 6th century and join the rest if the world in the 21st century and we will double standards galore. Can't have it all your own way. If they choose that lifestyle why should you care? 9/11 created by Christians Iraq attackedby Christians ISIS by Christ what fuck u want fr Muslim I don't as long as they stay there not come to Europe and force their 6th century behaviour on us and you're mother she's christian motherfucker??? and syria what is it??? Muslims killing muslims... Or christians?? go head attack Iraq again,the world can use stability&amp;bring ur Christian democy2 world wth bush Next It's Iran You're missing the point. Am i? Bravo agreed, these will be difficult and sad times. Thank You for those words The level of ignorance, bigotry &amp; (yes) poor English reading comprehension in these comments is staggering. clearly a lot! there is ur answer. Keyboard warrior Indeed! Where did he go? so he was a Christian terrorist? Imagine that! he ran like a bitch from ur question I would guess ! does that make him a non-terrorist? 1 Christian terrorist V how many Muslim you do the maths you cretinous wank stain love the insults. Thank you for the enlightened words. you said all terrorists were Muslim. I corrected you with facts. keep going its good to have tweets to report go write an opera üòÇüòÇ gold go fuck yourself you hideous tramp this is the level of the argument. 12 people die and you're going with fat comments and pork chops. Wow. 25 Deadliest Mass Shootings in U.S. History Fast Facts  via there's nothing about 15 y.o girls getting married in Qur'an,this is all wrong,they like to come up with new rules from their own hope so. Coz its just too sad that Muslims apply rules meant for that age &amp; that region on themselves, everyone around &amp; this age.. rules on whats wrong and right, how to wash ass and what food to avoid.. maybe it was good for survival of that nation at that time what today's muslim say is that they have a duty to force everyone else in the world to do the same. to have same imaginary friend. Muslims' duty is to make everyone in the world to eat same food and wash ass in that same particular way. or else.. ""moderate"" Muslims are trying to re-write Quran. Bring different meanings to verses. you've tried that - different schools of islam ended up in bloodshed.. and now this.. Violence. Root: beliefs.. being muslim and a saudi myself i hear all kinds of new rules that uneducated people set as if it was something that god said Islamization is there. :( but I strongly believe that there will be no religion in 100-200 years from now. don't you agree? yeah.. true. ppl always try to highjack idea.. people who have strong beliefs will stick to their beliefs and the other way around , you really never know i learnt that i should ignore  people and only listen to whatgod say not what they say bc frankly you can't trust people nowadays yes exactly , where i live people who have no life that's how they get off , by making up new rules and force you to follow it Makes Sense Clearly! Btw, how's Australia copping with your latest tragedy, the Cafe hostage situation? Like putting gas on a fire now? had memorials and lots of media coverage but moved on quickly. Been distracted by France, and the plane crash, bushfires Israel is a transplanted organ the body has rejected The drugs don't work &amp; the long term prognosis is very bad like your face ??

"This cartoon by Robert Mankoff from The New Yorker Sept 2012.
#CharlieHebdo http://t.co/pyQfnV42Su"," WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING THE INUIT WAY OF LIFE LIKE THIS!?!?!!*runs out of exclamation marks* Some people also love not being murdered for satirising ideas which blatantly need to be satirised, but hey ho. I wasn't contesting that. It was the reference to political correctness I was questioning. as a white person I feel deeply offended by this cartoon! Nothing's wrong with being PC at all, but not being so shouldn't expose you to the risk of terrorist attack Being politically correct is to pretend living in a world that doesn't  should focus on RL? I don't think the terrorists were concerned about 'political correctness'. Equating the two is, er, snide. Why is it so white? Seems racist. What, we shouldn't try to oppose racism and sexism because racism and sexism exist, you mean?! Well, they appear to have been concerned about being insulted. I take your point, however. Criticising religion is often seen as unPC, the term is ambiguous. I agree with avoiding racism in satire though. There's that word again ""offended"" again, do you use it to describe everything? There's everything wrong with being PC, it's brainwashing of the worst kind. the problem is you can be proud of who you are unless you're a straight white man You disgust me. How can this be your priority when people are dying over a cartoon! VILE PC as a smear is how the Right attacks human rights &amp; equality. Similar to SHRIEKINGFEMINIST. Robert Mankoff, The New Yorker, septembre 2012 CHARLIEHEBDO  via 'Brainwashing' is a actually a bit of a myth. You're a bit of an idiot. ‚Äú: This cartoon by Robert Mankoff from The New Yorker Sept 2012.CHARLIEHEBDO Then I stand with George Orwell on that then. Highlighting issues in society with satire is not racism, it's talking about it. Unlike pol. cor. that does nada. Why on earth would you feel the need to be 'proud' to be a man and white?! That's an accident of birth. be proud of who you are Nope, you've lost me there I'm afraid. Right, how can the survival of your people by your priority?! You monster! I am proud of who I am, as an individual, in some ways. I'm not taking credit or blame for accidents of birth, however. Don't think Orwell ever used the term 'brainwashing'. A lot of what he says about language and power in 1984 is dodgy. sorry you don't seem to get the point of ' cartoon I drew you a picture. POLITICALLY correct text together with SATIRE. RELIGION Er, nice. Are you opposed to religious freedom then? I'm sorry if you still don't get it.: Very Can you explain to me why you're proud to be a) white and b) a man? you misunderstand me, this terrible murder appearantly happened because people can't face satire. can you explain why I shouldn't be? sorry I don't get your point or maybe you don't get the point I was trying to make Jens. Satire is truly dead. Did they even look at the cartoon. probably they didn't but hopefully satire is not dead I hope you see my earlier posting about in a different light as what it was: satire So ""newspeak"" is dodgy? I think the notion that thoughts can be made unthinkable by modifying language is lacking in credibility No, the onus is on you to explain why you hold a certain view, not on me to explain why I don't. Then you must be living in a cupboard, hear no evil, see no evil, but speaking utter horseshit. Oh i'm sorry I thought you were capable of an adult discussion, my bad. there's no onus on me. You 'oppose' sexism/racism yet claim my gender/ethnicity is an accident?Double Standards. Tried that, you appear to be impervious. Everyone's gender and ethnicity is an accident. Did you decide to be a white man? You say that you're proud to a white man. I asked you why. That's a reasonable question. why is that an accident? I can ejaculate &amp; tan (simultaneously if I wish) That is genuinely funny, nice one. But it suggests you're not really serious about being proud of being white and being a man. Yes I was replying to. Satire appreciated. My Mistake and sincere apologies Jens Not sure I understand the question? I appreciate your apology it's sometimes hard to recognize satire ;) Touch√©;) So yer pa accidentally fell over on yer ma and U sprog out? ""Political correctness"" is just a PC way of saying ""phoniness.""""Enhanced interrogation"" is PC. ""Enhanced interrogation is pc"" &lt;&lt; I'm afraid you're confusing two totally different things. yeah, that's a euphemism. completely different thing. two completely different kinds of euphemism, I think you mean. Political satire is one of the greatest forms of freedom of expression in a free press.LIBERTY Having lived thru 9/11,I must say that peace starts with usLet's agree to disagreePEACE To u All!

"Anyone that believes tolerance is the solution to militant islam, remember this picture.  #CharlieHebdo  http://t.co/SGVZjaUqgV"," clearly Do we now understand what the Crusades were all about? This is the Muslim culture since evil was consolidated in Islam. Islamists have declared war on the civilized world. We either defend ourselves or suffer. No more Islam! does anyone preach tolerance to militant Islam? Surely it's tolerance to peaceful Islam... Is this an unarmed French police officer? Evidently, these guys don't give a damn about HANDSUPDONTSHOOT. Looks like he has a holster on hid right hip. please don't tweet that to me. Not sure police are armed in France. I'd be shooting. are you a Muslim sympathizer? If so you deserve what they will get soon! I don't appreciate those photos. They are disrespectful to the victims. So EFF off. Gendarme are armed, then there is the town police unarmed, I think he looks like a Gendarme, I think so in Paris. every American should be required to look at these photos! Only then will they know ISLAM! TY.  Very sad and tragic. Where were his partners? The big wheel turn and backlash will be disproportionate beware harlots It is a cop. Of course he has a holster! Did you not see the video? (Brutal.) He was already injured! Does ANYONE keep up with the news??? They did not show him actually getting shot, although the video did. Don't think still is bad. not that picture. Some other fool was tweeting horrible pics of beheadings. I asked him to stop. AHHHH. I did not see that one. Yeah. Gruesome. I've seen so many, though....{shrugs} the idiot then accused me of sympathizing with extremists. So I blocked him. That was quite a leap. You don't want to see beheadings, so you must sympathize with terrorists? yeah the killers even stated it was while killing. This was revenge for Moe. this is not Islam!! All muslim aren't the same! Islam don't say kill anyone don't talk if you don't know anything about it. sorry but don't talk about Islam if u don't know anything about it they aren't Muslim!!they terrorists,how them ""be Muslims"" if they  kill another Muslims? ask them. unfortunately you are right.armed forces are not armed (only tazer guns). üòî then why do they say they have avenged their prophet ? Of course they are Muslims surprisingly all terrorists invoke Allah. Do you think they are Buddhists or Catholics ?! They aren't really muslims! I'm muslims and my messenger mohammed don't said ... well what are they ? They definitely are not Jews or Catholics said kill anyone talk about me ,  he make punishment for anyone kill another ! if was he here, he doesn't like what happened!! muslims follow Coran, Islamists follow Coran. But they are not the same ? oO I don't know who they are to be honest .. sorry but they are all the same, the only good MUSLIM is a dead 1 me neither. But they call upon Allah. Just like Muslims. ""Whoever kills an innocent soul, it's as if they had killed the entire humanity"" this is in Corran . this is from Coran ? Coz these assholes don't know about that ""like Muslim "" not "" really muslim "" it's different. yes honey it's in coran üòî because this I say they are not muslim. no not dead I'm alive and my family my country all I knows. just one of the terrorist don't make all us like them. like killers. I know all I ever need to know. 9-11-2001 and on and on and on. I will talk about it all I want do you understand? You haven't read the Koran have you. It's full of killing infidels. Get real!",0
"This doesn't represent all Muslims, but, sorry, it does represent the official Islamic school of a certain key Arab state. #CharlieHebdo"," Should that state be named? Nobody even knows IF they were muslims, or just CIA-men posing as such. Don't jump to conclusions! I'm dense.  Which islamic school and which Arab state? Technically, 2. Sorry, it does represents Islam as in Koran and Sunna. Face it. thats unfair. Most Saudi Arabian scholars have strongly criticised these sort of attacks. In fact, the late Ibn Baz was.. one of the first to condemn suicide bombing. The same who pour Europe mosques with hundreds milions $. Qatar and KSA terrorists states. That was one of my guesses. Thanks. As an atheist I don't see these  as representing Islam any more than the KKK represent Christianity. CHARLIEHEBDO You Sure Luad Lad? CIA men???? Go set your head on fire until your face resembles a melted wellington boot! sir but was it right to draw such cartoons and then take pride in such offensive actions against Muslims?? Does that warrant a death sentence? FOE isn't just for the people you agree with. Stop making excuses. yes as in a Muslim killing HIMSELF he had no problem with killing others Lebanon? the police told them to think before publishing this. I wish they could have thought what, not Lebanon man Saudi, the key sponsor &amp; source of global Salafist terrorism for decades now Joking Man.I live in Lebanon :) Never understood the rationale of those who excuse such horrific acts. Except to just their own prejudices. there is no excuse brother but these lives cud hv been saved or not ??? Y we don't think about that üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ What? don't blurt out nonsense if you have no knowledge behind it. Oh, I dare you to prove me wrong! Are you suggesting they deserved it or what? People taking their fairy tales way too seriously are the problem. no dear I am only saying extremists within us will do such things so we need a dialogue over this thing. Those lives cud be saved gladly lol.Quran 5:32Quran 60:8Quran 15:2-3Most importantly Quran 2:256 a better understanding of the European freedom of expression and the place of Prophet(Pbuh) in Muslim faith terror can never be crushed unless u adress it's root causes. Islamic societies r not secular ones and thus problems arise. Oh, don't tempt me! What about Koran 9:5, 28, 29? Petatte Met Handvatte Botauto Is this your Islam or the Islam of Muhammad? the word Peace is mentioned much, much more often in the Quran. This is the Islam of Prophet Muhammad pbuh What do you do with the Verse of the Sword (Koran 9:5)- that diaster of Allah? we are discussing, you don't have to get offensive or defensive. I gave you the proper interpretation ^ correct step would be to spread true islamic knowledge before verses like this are misinterpreted But it's not misinterpreted - it's very clear and all prominent Muslim scholars agree on it. that's a lie and you know it, how could you say that after I fully gave you the correct tafseer? speak with your brain and not with your heart Aaah, so you want me to take your tafseer and ignore all Muslim scholars and also the clear text? the Quran isn't meant to be taken completely literally nor was every verse intended for every era It is a book for different situations in different ages and which sheikhs? the major ones all denounce this I am not interested in your Selective Islam but in Original Islam, that is, of Muhammad, and it's not good. this is original Islam and you're basing that on your opinion, you're picking and choosing what you want you're completely ignoring the peace verses and all the good that it has in it and misinterpreting a couple of verses that no major shyookh agree with you on. Haha!Do you even believe yourself? I'm citing the Quran and saheeh Tafseer, you've offered nothing but your opinion and blind hatred. how did I expect you to be one of those typical apologists of Islam! CIA? Look who's jumping to conclusions... so you're not? You are not one of the guys who already KNOW they were in fact muslims? I have no claim to know the truth, nor does anyone else. Find them, prove it, then we'll know Yeaaaaaa boooyyyyyyy AFDRUIPROVER 100% Rundvlees on the contrary, he condemned both!",0

#CharlieHebdo http://t.co/YmQqlYNbnx"," A usual, politicians will avoid the elephant in the room and go for an easy out. Noone wants to take away your bloody freedom of speech.If I drew a cartoon of your mum with rude things ud like that? being offended doesn't give backward cretins the right to slaughter people. FFS. This inane comment shows how brain dead you are and how easily you are willing to kill. Go fuck yourself sure buddy we would paint the street with blood.... idiot. The apologists are already out in droves. The bodies aren't even cold yet! I understand but don't mislabel what is freedom of hatred. We Love the final messenger more than our parents. I wouldn't like it.. But I wouldn't MURDER PEOPLE IN COLD BLOOD. Freedom of speech allows you your right to be offended Would drawing a rude picture of Rita's mum give her the right to kill your family??? IMBECILE Not to Murder as a catholic, I guess I better go kill the members of Monty Python for 'The Life of Brian.' Also nobody said it gives the right for anyone to kill some one else. Why you implying I said it? does not justify the actions of these cowards. Shooting at unarmed people. Disgusting and unhumane. Excellent. Oh shut up you really aren't worth a reply. Only brain dead one is you mate we wouldn't go round killing people you filthy arse wipe The question you twat was whether or not she'd like it. I was replying to her freedom of speech post You don't seem to understand at all. Your position seems like an apologia for this atrocity. I think he prefers goats to fuck... Nothing to do with the regrettable incidents that just took place in paris you are justifying the actions of murderers by sympathising with their anger. Engineering student! So are you making the Bombs or flying the plane, kid? Make no mistake - all sides of the political spectrum are united against this atrocity. No justification. Why are you shouting at me in text like I too would find that acceptable?The post I was replying to had nothing to do with france True I &amp; others were offended by Gilliard/KRudd/Milne/SHY etc. antics but no1 took a pot shot at them ... ""regrettable incidents"". . Mate, you are the problem. It was only freedom of speech and 'Islamic extremism' so anyone against those disgusting cartoons is an Islamic extremist? Another useless Islamist. What is an Islamic extremist? Did I say it would moron? Did the post I reply to have anything to do with france? Dont just jump in Go ahead. What u telling me for. Did I say murder is okay? and the organisers of Adelaide festival for their 'come heckle Christ' show WHO THE BLOODY HELL IS TALKIN ABOUT FRANCE. The post was about freedom if speech and extremism Read the tweets first dearie then come back to me. See if killing or france is mentioned at all Justifies killing people because of a cartoon.. Obviously his goat Goat has it's period. ""Evil only wins when good men do nothing"" - Edmund Burke It isn't. Why would I be required to apologise for someone idk. Do you apologise for every crime? Committed by ppl who share your faith or your race? you are saying there's some sort of reasoning behind their actions. There wasn't. They're barbarians. I am sympathising with the anger of 1.8billion people, i am sympathising with my own anger. Noone has the right to disrespect us. We we DID do something; we democratically sacked them from office ... Maybe both. I wouldn't tell you anyway. Make no Mistake I Did Not Condone or Support It How am I the problem? You want me to cry for ppl I didn't even like? Why am I part of the problem? can't we all just get along? See, that's where you're wrong Do you cry for the 300thousan syrians killed by bashar? Or the 1.5million iraqis killed by usa? Should I say you should feel guilty for every crime committed by a white person or christian? go find a fresh goat &amp; go ya hardest. Why you holding me accountable just because supposedly we share the same faith. Wow. You mug the post I was replying to had nothing to do with france or these murders. Was talking bwt freedom if I justified their reason for committing a crime, I would be in some way complicit, yes. After you accuse me of wanting to murder and bomb people. Up yours mate. Nope. I think you need to be diagnosed. You're sick minded. say a christian killed their boss for firing so many ppl. If u said as a christian firing the ppl was wrong, u condone murder? Yeah A worry. Okay u keep thinking that. But when some1 gets really angry over you insulting someone he holds dearer than his mother Don't act surprised when said someone decides to take the law into his/her own hands. They're asking me to cry for journalists that made it their life's aim to insult us Muslims Isn't all human life equal? What about the innocent civilians france bombs daily? Why don't we cry about them. Or are your lives worth more than our? Presumably you'd want these rights to not be religiously disrespected to be enumerated by laws. What do you propose? its already in the law, what they did many times were hate crimes and could have been punished by law Personally I'f never resort to violence if someone insulted my mum because I'm a rational person who isn't insecure Maybe you are but you can't expect everyone to be the same. Insult everyone one person will snap. Its to be expected Just keep religion what it is. Sacred. So a cartoon punished by the criminal justice system because someone claimed offense. Just want to get this straight bloke obviously has a screw loose Yh. Ppl have been punished for much less. A screw loose because I value all human life equally? It's not sacred. Nothing is sacred. The more you rebel against humanist liberties the more irrelevant you become They were asking me to cry for 12 ppl. I said I cry for millions. Do you? Okay good luck with that. no you don't. ""I won't cry for them"" and ""what would you do if the carton was of your mum"" I won't be crying for u. The more you squirm about being offended the deeper you sink into the quicksand. Just another forgotten cargo cult 12 lives = 12 lives. Equal. u guys only cry for 12 and ignore hundreds killed by France you clearly do not value human life at all and sympathise with extremism Bro thats it our moment is over. You can go away now. Stop begging it Ofookuugay them. 12 Equal?What do you mean? What extremism do I sympwith?I love extreme kindness extreme love extreme generousity I mean i hold all lives equal. 12 lives equal another 12 lives. 300000&gt;12 priorities what's ur point? R u saying 12 deaths in France is justified because more have died abroad? How dare you.I am saying that there are others more worthy formy lamenting over their loss why is that? What makes it less significant for you? Well on one side you have hundreds being killed by a government.On the other 12 by 2 dudes but I thought you said all life is equal so isn't the number irrelevant? All life equal. Is hundreds equal to 12. No. That would be saying those 12 lives worth mre exactly however this recent event in France shows the extremist attitude to peoples freedom of speech Did u guys know one of the policemen who was killed trying to protect the french was a Muslim.

I see a lot of religious whiteness over here. Pitt your statement hit the nail right in the head but like I tell all everyone has a choice to make and that all it is a choice and we should not impose our choices on no one else either am sen to that but as more as more of the truth comes out about this big lie we have been fed as kids people will have to decide which will they choose religious whiteness please do explain For me friend,a Biblical spiritual center is not of racist white men...the tribe of Judah was/is Black The institution of our language Are you AFRAIDOFTHEDARK? I agree these evil sort as you say,""stole"" Christianity therefore to relinquish it to them is weakness Looks like they are trying to stirrup trouble.  :-) We agree...this whiteness as in racist supremacy is in full effect, but they do not own Christianity Gen 15/13 explains who""The Black Man in the Americas"" is whiteness is different I agree funny how that has offended some of my followers and its backed up by scripture also lol a d you give them these scripture Genesis 32:28 Jacob and Israel, Rev 1:14-17 description of Jesus Big part of the Secret Society deception has been blinding us from seeing ourselves in the Bible also Rev 2:9 those that called themselves Jews, these r not my words lol admittedly the poster would be better, albeit less snappy, if it stated ""kill yourself in an isolated place with no bystanders"" and bend it to suit their agenda There is no easier way to control masses than Religious deceptions , it appeals to inner convictions. but for the life of me I cannot understand why it's so insulting to Muslims to dicuss or criticize this religion Pitt some got offended when I posted vids of that, what they should b offended by us being lied too about the bible see I followed Jesus when I thought he was white because of his goodness not his color and if they r really Christian they will accept the truth as told by the book we say we love what does the bible say! They have eyes but do not see and ears but do not hear, and some have been turned over to a reprobated mind where they will embrace a lie before they believe the truth been that way since they rewrote the bible with King Jqmes of England - ...or religion-like deceptions, like 'The Word of the Prophet Ailes'.

The entire free world should respond, ruthlessly."," respond against who? what should that 'ruthless' response look like? We should respond in UNITY. Not with more violence. More violence is never an answer to violence. Never was. Never will be. What is a ruthless response? Another war on terror? Followed by another attack, then another war, and then... by angrily tweeting? Wrong. Was in 1941. Is now a start would be to publish satire of Hebdo style in every major newspaper. A message of resilience. Yeah look what that braught us. Millions dead. Wanna do that again? Fire a bullet in Hate and you will get more hate OTOH you could have been tweeting that in German. I reckon that‚Äôs exactly the intended reaction. I live on the German Border as Dutch. Maybe that's why I feel so strong about this. I don't know. Hitler in Paris? Fine with you, I see. Chill, kick back, let evil do what it will. Read history. The free world did not act ruthlessly in 1941. Right. Give me the Hitler was a socialist argument. Haven't heard that one in two whole days. How do you think Hitler would have responded to radical non-violence? At whom should this violence be directed beyond the specific perpetrators, and what form should it take? It began to. And then it did. Help me out here. I'm getting bored. Are you kidding me? Oh trust me. I will fight if I have to. But I will join the underground fight. Don't teach me history. My family had a choice. Boat or camp. I will be damned to see that again. Indeed. It's easier to respond with violence to a nation-state than this. And who or what do you think saved them? Pacifism???? A goddamn roof over their head and solidarity is what saved their ass. Don't you judge me mr Violence. response must be both merciless and respectful of our legal system. Period ""If only"" things were as simple as 1941. However, then as now, an end to all foreign occupations would be a start I don't judge you. I despair of you and wish you well. Finaly. Common sence. I guess NYT rather wants violence then to answer that. Oh Irony. Scuse me. I'm Blocking someone now. This is with those remarks completely nuts or a servant to Compairing with WW2? I haven't heard a Hitler comment in Two whole days. Guess he found it time to amuse me. That ass. whatever form those in power would want, I guess - just not TEA &amp; COOKIES:  ‚Ä¶ As I sad an attack prob initiatedby to get France/EU on US-sde in war against terrorism That is Not My War. Ask me to help for peace and I'll say yes. Oh, hell nah. YOU THERE. SHHHH. Your generation got us here. Stfu. But you,, are right France/the free world should respond ruthlessly to the US............ come on people, keep on breathing please, take a deep breath CHARLIEHEBDO I'm afraid to make sarcastic suggestions fearing they might be taken seriously, but how about ""Lets Invade Irak!"" I did not caus'this thread. I do not want a NYT giving me the Hitler card. & GT; & GT; & GT;& lt; & lt; & lt;My tweet was to Mr.Cohen. I Hear of. That man is shifted.A journalist for the NYT who gives me the Hitler card and you ask if I want to keep my mouth shut?For real? If your tweet with the name of your newspaper in your Twitter account can I expect more wisdom in reactions? Much (although obviously not all) of WWII was fought strategically. And then we won. I could have sworn Hitler didn't go to Paris w/a handful of gunmen, but rather w/an army. It is what Bush/Cheney decided BEFORE 9/11. ""My Father blew it so we must bomb someone. Anyone."" I'm sure he said exactly the same when Breivik murdered 77 people, mostly kids. NY journalists never learn. They're paid not to learn. They think people are stupid...all the time. You are loosing your time. Psychopaths don't listen. So Silly...your Wirds about Paris Attack.. Get Real Ohno-Bibi warned he would get France for recognising Palestine.And we all see what a psycho he is.And protected Bibi does what he wants,when he wants.....no one stops him, or holds him to law. / CraZy Words Feel Same About You.to Me, You Are Blind.That's life Here is a lesson 'humanity' just doesn't seem to learn I agree with this. In retaliation, let's attack *puts on blindfold, points at spot on globe* uh, Papua New Guinea? indifference,a suitable attitude towards thisattack,withresp toall civ killed IRAQ DRONES IAMCHARLIE for they didn't get this ""attention/compassion"",didn't provocated anyone,just lived their lives DRONES Hitler worshipped eugenics programs in US prior to WW2. He also studied Indian genocide. Stop peddling hate. Would you mind leaving that coward paper out of my mentions? Thanks. Sorry, I meant to respond to Roger Cohen's statement about Hitler. I know. But they didn't have the balls to place an Hebdo Cartoon. So he can shuv his Hitler comment up his ass",0
Here's a rundown of the cartoons the #Muslim savages in Paris just slaughtered 12 people over: http://t.co/lg5H5cxXbW http://t.co/K1m6vMAPWh," I'llReadWithYou OBAMA warned us what would happen to those who slander islam. Then he turned about and called it the religion of peace. Copy Assad.. HE knows how to deal with these savages. but will France actually do something about their massive problem simmering in its ghettos ?  More to come until they act killing people avenges no one's honor. Those with honor can withstand any offense by ignoring it and leading by example. it's not religion or offending belief its barbaric, inhuman acts of terrorism. Thoughts with the families please don't blame all muslims. I'm a muslim and my prayers are going to Paris right now. Not all of us are like those bastards. Until they kick their butts out of their country this will keep happening. Muslims endearing themselves to the world again. There's an anti-islamic wave on the horizon. When it breaks, I don't want to hear any whining from these freaks. sorry yousif. You are right not all Muslims are the same. We are all in it together. Wish we could stop the madness They only understand VIOLENCE. and they are cowards. I don't blame you for thinking all muslims are the same, since many attacks have happened but most of us do NOT encourage these attacks, these people who do this have lost their humanity. It should result in millions more cartoons created. Not blaming all Muslims.  I am blaming those Muslims who killed 12+ people in Paris today. thanks for clearing it out. Prayers go to the families of the 12 victims. PARISSHOOTING repent from worshipping satanrepent and turn to the Lord Jesus Christ worshipping Satan? I think you've got it wrong, or at least i hope so. Please don't tell me how to live my life. you can live whatever life you wantbut if you try to save your life, you will lose it, but if you lose it, you will save it Get Lost Plz. its you who is lost OK but what do you do to STOP this? Only the members of the Muslim faith  can stop it. We should put incredible pressure on Muslim world to do so. All visas from Muslim nations should be suspended till we track down all overstayers in US. This will up (cont) the pressure on Muslim nations to enact serious, visible reforms, shut radical mosques, etc. yes sir. I wouldn't put it all on the Muslim faith but these countries that claim to be peaceful need to help us in eliminating these radicals. I think it's going to take everyone to say that's enough Just like liberal tolerance. They love you... as long as you agree with everything they say. There's nothing more viciously intolerant than a pony-tailed professor. I'm thinking that if the muslims don't provide the pressure non muslims will be applying pressure on triggers Who's bald down the middle. The middle age mullet lol maybe not on all muslims just the ones that read the quran Does that include non-muslims? Should we b prosecuting John Derbyshire for instance? any radical terrorists would be a better term I suppose. And yes wipe them off earth I am using a marine generals saying. Please don't make me pull my weapon please if you do though I will wipe you and your party off the face of this earth Why assume the problem should be all Muslim responsibility - we're ALL responsible are you serious? I AM NOT responsible for anything these animals do it takes a special kind of stupid to make a statement like that when radical drunken sailors cause this kind of mayhem you can include them but so far it's been peaceful muslims reeking this kind of havoc Still making assumptions calling them ""animals"" and YES you are responsible if you do NOTHING to change the problem Well BOB you said itSpecial kind of stupid you can accept responsibility if you choose to but I don't Iwill do whatever is necessary to prevent this from happening there is a distinct difference in accepting and resisting if we kill people because of their faith then we are no better then the radical terrorists who kill us for simply being Americans. Find who is responsible and make them answer please don't use hurtful words. It's great to be able to debate don't kill them bcuz of their faith kill 'em bcuz they kill us yes sir. Death to those who threaten innocent lives just want to make my point that being Muslim does not make you a radical That is not really accurate... People who go around killing people (claiming they're innocent do not really read the Quran) Yeah, it was peaceful muslims who blew up the OK Fed building. &amp; don't forget those peaceful Cliven Bundy supporters who shot 2 cops in NV. how do u know it was the peaceful muslims?People who do such things do not even know the meaning of Islam,they just carry the name &amp; then there's Breivik in Norway. He's a Muslim; right? You're responding to the wrong person. Should be responding to . and the guilty parties are paying for the crime bcuz we Americans didn't accept it now you're just stretching the Bundy supporters were peaceful until attacked so do you have a point? Both attacks on wrld trade center were muslims muslims flew the plane into pentagon &amp; pa field they bombed uk subway and have committed 1000s of other attacks including on their own people Right! Only ur kind of terrorism is acceptable! I don't have a kind of terrorism do you? The ""moderate"" moslem runs interference, spreads disinfo, supports, and defends the radical. Let's be clear: If believe behavior od those at Bundy Ranch &amp; after accepatble, 1/2 u're no different than those who find Hadro acceptable. Only different ideology. you are aptly name for your orwellian thinking. You haven't a clue what I think Funny, coming from some1 who stated Bundy's were right to break the law. You could just call them terrorists then. Any religion is just a way to claim power. You cannot win a war by simply proclaiming moral superiority to your enemy no sir you can't. But that's no excuse for genocide either. You must be thinking about genocide. I never said it. sorry sir :) I was in a bunch of conversations yesterday I was trying to stress the importance of not labeling all Muslims as radical",0
"As a Muslim, I absolutely refuse to apologize for this terrorist act. But as a Muslim,I demand justice for the victims&amp; say: #JeSuisCharlie"," who do u have to apologize to and why would your apology be needed Why?You did not do it YEAH Exactly. What are apologies for after the deed has been done! Finally someone speaking sense. I elect you the president of Libya! I'll send the Wreaths the following day to your funeral.. Your muslimness has nothing to do with the attack. You are being apologetic just when saying you dont. Great words. she really isn't you know, but she is more than capable of telling you that herself not only that but like ... Ahh never mind Muslim tweeps are acting like paranoid congressmen:""I vehemently denounce these heinous crimes against humanity.Islam is love"" I know. I can understand why-we've been out on the defensive. But we can take a breath and choose our own path. if I had to apologize every time a Muslim did something wrong I'd make a career out of it. Chief Apologizing Officer. o Insult to the Prophet? I can think of no greater insult to God than to have the temerity to end the life of His creation. perfect. your tweet on creation is my quote of the day on my radio show in the US today Amen. MT Insult to the Prophet? I can think of no greater insult to God than the temerity to end the life of His creation. wait, isn't it a direct injonction by the said god to kill infidels and apostates? Oh really? How do you know that? Try some psychology. Perception filan. RT: Insult to the Prophet? I can think of no greater insult to God than to have the temerity to end the life of His creation. I wish I cld get straight who is supposed to be under attack from this mockery : the Prophet, or God? Which is worse? There is No God!Wake up. That only makes sense to people that have sense. that's a little juvenile and an appropriate response would be ""how do you know"". But there is a context to her and you + +don't seem to get it. But that's fine. Christians look at this Islamic god and say, ""How weak that he can't withstand satire"" insult the consituation and there is death penalty articale 6 ,Propht pbhm  is greater then your made consituation Exactly. She is a juvenile and trying to free herself from indictment against her identity which is under construction. I am not sure. I just presume, think. My clue is the as a Muslim part. Why did she highlight that? Think. she highlighted it because she lives in America where there is a narrative saying that Muslims should apologise for attacks + and she highlighted it to say she rejected it. Exactly. That is my point. Two Muslim identities. One is apologetic, mild, no threat. The others terrorists that she just made no not really. Muslims dont have to say anything about this attack. Condemning it ""as a Muslim"" undermines Islam perception further! that was her point. She wasn't condemning it as a Muslim or apologising for it or whatever. and to be fair I think murderous acts being perpetrated in name of (insert religion) do most to undermine (insert religion) Why did not you condemn it as a Christian, or as a human, or as a male, or as a brown eyed, or liberal, or rightist? Then just think. Who can be behind these things? Muslims? You can insert it. Dont worry. We know. if a murderous attack was perpetrated by people in the name of Scottish independence (let's say) then I may feel obligated + to condemn it as a human and make the same point about not having to condemn it as a support of an independent Scotland I don't think you know as much as you claim. At the present time, the evidence seems to point to lunatics claiming to do + Obligated? Then some can think that we can use this logic? What happened in 9/11?? + this in name of Islam. If I were a Muslim this would probably bother me (see my Scottish independence example) What bothers me is the Puppet holder. Who did Danƒ±≈ütay attack im Turkey? Think that too. yes obligated. If people were killing others in the name of something I believed in (independence) then rightly or wrongly+ I would feel the need to defend my belief from what was tainting it. Occam's razor. Conspiracy theories are intellectually lazy I am disgusted with all these terrorism stuff. Who did this is the sole responsible. Not any muslim! of course, you are 100% right. But you also have to be concerned that something you believe in is getting a bad PR Occam's razor is just a rule of thumb. Reality can have multiple facets. I am not lazy to look beyond the seeming. A bad PR? I dont care what others think. Reality is superior to PR. and it's a very useful rule of thumb at that. reality can have multiple facets but that does not take away from my point. that is a very 'Turkish' response, if you pardon the generalization. The Cyprus case is a great example as to why PR&gt;reality Are you being racist? I can label it as Mevlutish. That's my point. I am not Representative of Turkness or maleness. Cuz the Western people always demand Muslims to apologise for something we didn't commit well said, really, to the point!! it's madness. Those guys were warned too and still did it. I Getcha Irony:Terrorists have done for CHARLIHEBDO what their prophet cartoons could never have done:gain the solidarity of millions of Muslims. thank you. Insult to the Prophet? I can think of no greater insult to God than to have the temerity to end the life of His creation via These attacks against civilians also incur a wrath of vengeance unfortunately against Muslims, most being innocents. ""made constitution"" Yes. Made by people. Just like religion, but w/o absurd claims of gods &amp; ""prophets"". Why are you thinking about gods &amp; ""prophets"" *at all* in the 21st Century?! Unbelievable. every country have right to make there own law according to there religion or there culture so Muslim aslo if muslim country make any law for there country according to what they belive its there democratic right We have rights for many things; this doesn't mean we have *reasons*. All religions fail that test. it does not mean any induveduel decide himself and start killing, Laws against killing make sense. Religion is not required. if majority of people in one country belive one thing its there right to chose in your eyes its right or not Stories about gods don't become true because people believe them. Facts are still facts. Don't fall for myths! democary is role by majority inint ? you got single vote then you have to get more people on your side so keep preaching Preaching is for god people. I'll stick with talking sense. well keep it up dear every one free to belive, you belive nothing we belive something Common believer argument: don't believe in my god? Then you believe ""nothing "". Hmmm.. what is nothing? tell me your argument what your belief ? About what? Believer thinks: My magic story is true unless doubter knows all. Doesn't see problem with this way of thinking. do you think ? Or you just doubt on others thinkings Doubt is an important part of wisdom. Accepting what is commonly believed is laziness &amp; fear of being different. who decide what is wisdom  whats wisdom in your eyes might in my thinking its ignorence Yes. Believer always thinks his belief is best. But never has any evidence &amp; always has bad reasons. Wonder why. so you're suggesting we should LISTEN to terrorist threats lest they terrorize us. GOODBYE FREEDOM. no, but be mindful and smart enough to realise something's are best left alone or not worth it would suggest these killers do the same, (leave it alone, it's not worth it) wouldn't you? fortunately there is still plenty of people in the world that is able to put freedom and life at the same level",0
"It didn't take that long. The first Pakistani to say, #CharlieHebdo massacre has nothing to with Islam, has emerged. http://t.co/UBRm7FJPfl"," MT Didn't take that long. 1st Pakistani to say, CHARLIEHEBDO massacre has nothing to with Islam, emerged No doubt you will hear it on BBC and LBC soon. I've alREADY SEEN SEVERAL - Unbelievable But not surprising. Islamists seem adept at being at our throats and our knees simultaneously... - When are our governments going to finally take Islamic threat seriously. These aren't isolated - Can you imagine the danger we'd be in if Trudeau was in charge. The first thing govts have to do is to stiffen their backbones and label the threat correctly... This day has been tragic enough... It's false conflating of Islam w/race -Islam is ideological threat Oh dear God no !!!! Who is conflating it with race? - It's a threat that politicians have to stop with PC &amp; treat it 4 what it is - Terrorism -I hope this is a wake up call for the left, we can't have ourselves at Islams mercy No we can't - enough is enough There is a way to fight this evil without condemning all Muslims. But not by equivocating... -Too many verses in Quran that calls 4 death of non believers. Sorry I've had enough - Never any real out cry from them  when this stuff happens.  No I don't trust them What we need are more people like Tarek Fatah. He's never been equivocal at these times... On experience, very unlikey to wake up many. - Hope not, ppl r putting their heads in the sand. When will enough be enough Sadly, the 'left' is full of muslims &amp; their supporters. This isn't a left vs right issue. It's a good vs evil issue... The 'factions' have infiltrated ALL parties. - it's been both the liberals &amp; Obama who refuse to acknowledge that this - Is a threat to our safety. When they do it's begrudgingly. Assisting the jihad is their goal. - Yes &amp; too many blind ppl that don't take this seriously. I have friends that still deny it but MOST have come around to see. - playing with fire. Grandsons girlfriend is Muslim. Family from ME, - The father hates us, lives here, takes all our of our good life but hopefully, no honour killing in your future Maryann. - Hates us. That's a common feeling, they don't want assimilation but - Subtigation. We can't let these atrocities change who and what we are... Most peaceful muslims don't know they are being used to infiltrate.naive - Don't think that hasn't crossed my mind. She was in hospital &amp; they I have muslim friends who are oblivious to Islam's empirical formula. - Ignored her. My daughter &amp; grandson was only 1 to take care of her. - No I've seen enough up close. He is a tool for jihad. Good luck and I sincerely mean it. - I'm also basing what I've also had 1st hand interaction. -they don't agree with our lifestyle. They live here but want us to change - Makes you wonder. My son in law had Muslim at working that would rant - Hate 4 us. He used to tell us about him. - Thanks, really nice little girl, we had her over  4 Christmas &amp; I worry - Wondered if the dad would get angry with her. Yet they must not be ignored either. If he knows she present for the worship/celebration of Christ she n danger",0
"To all my Muslim friends: you don't need to apologize for the #CharlieHebdo attack in Paris. A criminal committed a crime, not Islam."," Exactly if only the media and the wider community could also understand this.....islam is not the problem This MUSLIMS are murdering each other at industrial levels. They do it b/c their book tells them too.... Blame plain to see you're a brave young man. Who's apologising? shame. I agree with his views on Israel. finally someone that's a decent human beig haha x In the name of Islam, though. There needs to be loud and widespread condemnation in the media from the Muslim community. agreed always is but not publicised as it should be...currently on national news condemning Media had their part to play too, they have to give more air time to moderates. the Quran doesnt tell them to kill. Islam and religion in general is about harmony and love. Dont talk if u dont know shit Definitely..... Great maturity bro! who is apologizing , dis is gleeful , revenge is so sweet bt i see u r doomed,ur openness hs made europe d kitchen sink fr moslem cockroaches,d aftreffects wil b hard 2 bear wt u do nt undastnd is dat dis is xactly wat millions read n dream f in mosques all ovr, i pity ur ignorance That didnt make sense. dis is d history f a cowardly religion n its followrs in brief ,europe is nw at tipping point you clearly have little knowledge of the subject. Love roses,chocolates....jeezzzzzz ! Holocaust deny too? Go read something I'm sure I have more knowledge than you because this is about MY religion and for sure I know more about it than u. The islam doesnt tell people to kill. U can't label all muslims as terrorists just bc some stupid people do shit. bye you probably have good intentions but you make sweeping assumptions based on emotions. Yr ppl are dying every day!!!! if you know more about our religion, please quote from the Qu'ran word for word where it says you can kill the Quran says that whoever kills an innocent is killing the entire human race so what are you saying You should read Peter Townsend ""questioning islam""......I have, but you will not. there's no point in reading someone's views on islam because i really couldn't care less, the book says something, unlike the bible, you do not interpret the Quran the way you want to Read the Quran. I have, but you will not. : have you read the Quran? do you know shit? You should read Townsend book because its historically revealing. The contradictions in Q are many. regardless, the Quran never asks muslims to kill in the name of God or kill at all yea. I do know shit it's a peaceful religion, some of the people practicing it are simply not oh I have read many parts of it.....not all, as I'm not good with fiction. However, the law of abrogation Theo, you can plead ""peaceful"" forever.....empirically, followers are murdering women/kids every day. Ask them how peaceful I is TOWNSENDS book contains no opinion...he shows each contradiction from original or accepted texts.. my name is not Theo and as I said, the religion isn't violent, the people are &amp; you shouldn't see him as muslims but theo, are you content that ISLAM is worshiping the Jewish god Yaweh? And the xtian god in the same person? human beings, some people are bad and others are not, we're all the same regardless of our beliefs, this is the 21st century Don't be so singleminded .. this has nothing to do with the topic we were discussing I agree we are all he same, I'm a humanist.....angry at the killing of children, justified by a false god from 1500 years ago. we are discussing the voracity of verse which promote killing. I have shown you hat.. God was telling Muhammad that he is with the muslims, strengthening them and putting faith in their hearts and on the contrary putting fear in nonbelievers' hearts and he encouraged them to fight them because they were torturing- -Muslims in Quraish and everywhere they encountered them, so this has nothing to do for muslims fighting each other There's an elephant in the room.....the Q has several versions     Only ATHEISM doesn't kill ppl. and btw a muslim killing another muslim is considered he Fifth Greater sin in Islam so you can NEver say that it's written and btw this is an actual verse in quran you are totally free for your choices :) ,i was just making it clear that there was a misunderstanding. there are going to be an awful lot of Muslims in hell, wouldn't you agree? i totallyy agree, what these people do is inhumane and totaly unreligious it has nothing to do with islam trust me just one more thing, read more and open your mind to all ideas, really. PAYNG more attention does not kill :) oh I read.........lots of books for me.....I know my roots and a tribe of flat earth believers is not it.  Salaam Maryam try reading Quran i mean, with 0 grudges Do you accept that thousands of readers of the Q, schooled in its teachings, kill women &amp;children? Simple question. Of Course not, they are not taught correct islam , don't Generalize the case SO DO YOU blame their teachers for incorrectly imparting the prophets teachings? Are you trying to stop the teachers. The first victim in the CHARLIEHEBDO attack was a police officer guarding the building. His name? Ahmed, there are 1.7billion muslims in the world and ever growing.. If the teaching were to kill.. Id be worried! 51 million Muslims became refugees last year.  Is this an acceptable cost for an idea? 51 million innocent ppl? For what? Richard have U ? have U read quran?If it says to killY snt evry muslim a killerThose who kill r illiterate n killersThey r nt muslims yes, i am blaming the incorrect teaching, and i am nit trying to stop the teaching, i am *encouraging*  correct teaching. the teaching is not to kill, the incorrect teaching kills, and it's sad because it's not a small percentage alas yes. never read holy book w so many passages railing agnst unbelievers people who consider themselves muslims and invoke passages in quran about killing infidels are illiterate and not muslims? huh? congrations...

I would just mind my own business, and keep myself with my own religion Time here Doesn't Matter only respect does and apparently you have no respect you say that hell is an invention but for me it is real and it exists in many religions i am a muslim and my islamic history tells me that christianity is a religion and it was God's religion before islam i have checked my history What about child sacrifice to quetzalcoatl. Legitimate religion? You must respect ALL RELIGIONS. my belief is that it's wrong but also I shouldn't offend it i know it's wrong but they probably think it's right and i am in no position to tell them otherwise You'd let a child be sacrificed for a religion? first of all i am not letting anything and second i told you it's wrong and what would you have done to stop them? Make fun of them like you are doing now? Wow what a way to retaliate there is a way to stop them but not by making fun of their beliefs or offending them Stopping the sacrifice angers Quetzlcoatl. Believers shout blasphemy. I'd beat the fuck out of them, You'd show due respect. first we are off topic and second there is something called persuasion if that is your retaliation then you are no different from them like i said there are many ways what if they were a little uneducated i say this because i don't even know what century they were in but anyways maybe they are uneducated then we can educate them show them how life is valuable how everyone deserves to liveon this earth in egypt there are a lot of uneducated children that do unspeakable things in the name of their survival",0
"Absurdly, I'm told this is not time to talk about reforming Muslim attitudes to ""blasphemy"". Seriously. What planet are we on? #CharlieHebdo"," the apologists will blame this either on jews or on american foreign policy and drones France is the intellectual home of Sociology. How about we actually apply some? Moslems call Islam ""Religion of Peace"", cos they believe there'll be Everlasting-Peace, when most everyone's been killed-off ! planet ""islamophobia"" - fear of criticizing islam. or, put differently, planet dhimmitude. seriosuly THIS is the kind of attitude from you that moderate democracy loving Muslims like do not understand because shouting allahu akhbar leaves matters in doubt? or maybe they were shouting ""o√π est le bar?"" yes, it does. Because we don't have an incident report. Its why its' called ""Speculation"". Dictionary. Use one. We have bigger priorities.  A rocket scientist wore a shirt that is an outrage. SHIRTSTORM don't be an idiot. don't like it - block. Add something useful or be silent or in the vernacular  - Do one. here ya go; read on BBC Wow, missed that one..  Outcome of the fundraising just made me cry. Yes, I'm sleep-deprived speaking out in support of satire is something that should be spoken about when satirists are killed by all its a new report. So? fallacious. Speaking out against murder isn't the same as attributing self serving narratives. or are you in favour of weaponising grief? self serving ideas which were used against? The hatred of satire &amp; depiction isn't an isolated idea I wish to go after the underlying cause aka the depiction of muhammad etc as justification to kill not really , you wish to go after muslims. You nick kind of gives it away. even if u were serious conversing on twitter about narratives, social construction and identity isn't possible read it duh? Ut clearly give account they were Islamists shout god is great in Arabic EVILCULT its still called speculation. That's why every govt minister is saying they don't know yet. Learn from them for someone big on rationality you do seem to be beholden to your cognitive reactions. I am asking you to read the article. It clearly states that men shouted god is great in Arabic. that mister is not speculation. Its fact. I'm asking you to be a rationalist and freethinker. That fact means very little in isolation. Data not speculation. I can point you to a good book by Allan Byrman if you want to know how to interpret facts. hahaha now you want me to interpret facts lololol you try. Read the article and interpret it how you want have you done any science.Social Science?I Assuming You're A GRADUATE how can you still doubt that? This is fucking incredible I could have assumed it was lots of things about Utoya Island. We're all working of our reactions right now. lol dude. that's not the point. You don't even have to be social scientist or graduate to understand the article. peace witness says they spoke bad french.Another says they claimed to AQ in Yemen. Gov said 2 attackers. Now we have 3.See? no but your questions are those of someone who hasn't read anything of note past highchool the ""facts"" are changing as we develop more sources of information. You're working off your cognitive baises. hahahahahahahaha you are just trying to procrastinate the inevitable. It's the humiliation that's gonna hit the apologists and this is why i don't take self-declared free thinkers and ""rationalists"" seriously oh for i? hahahahahaha .. Peace Out bro what. Exactly. Am I apologising for? Feel free to browse my timeline and find something before you talk such crap don't come at me with you cut &amp; paste edginess or I'm going to have to swear at you on twitter. I apologised for nowt take your own advice. No speculation. They shouted ""alluhah akbar"". The uncensored videos are here: you lot seem to think repeating the same thing makes you cleverer. They also spoke French. And? And they were muslim! And? from where? Which org? Who trained them? Were there 2 or 3? Those rifles are from where?  Know all that? nah they're If√° worshipping pagans man when Utoya Island happened YOU were busy telling everyone  it was definitely ""western civilisation""? Hypocrit. allegedly one of the Policemen confronting them was also Muslim. What does that do for your narrative? Muslims kill everyone for their cause. ISIS also kills muslims. That's what Allah commanded. ever heard of Boko Haram? They're Muslims who kill Muslims you're  obviously  more illiterate  than I thought. got to love these folk ever been to Lagos. I have. what about the insurgents in the delta? considering the state of Chibok, Boko Haram have many factors to them. What about Mohammed? He killed muslims for apostacy and called moderate muslims hypocrites. I doubt you have the time to consider the state of post Biafran Nigeria. which version of the seera is that in? Are you repeating the stuff off Answering Islam? when rightwing Pegida marched, still called them Germans. Why so hard to say jihadis are Muslim Goat I'm Nigerian goat I'm in Lagos. Tell me what I don't know I can tell you don't understand what antitheism is, it's the statement that even if god exists then it's cruel &amp; sadistic what has the deltan militants got to do with boko haram. Diverging ehh? yeah.. well I used to chill on Ikoyi. Aand you son should  pay more attention on class what pray tell? I'm listening I grew up in Ikoyi. Work in Ikoyi. So what? chibok and Port Harcout have serious issues which feed insurgencies. You know that. Don't act the big Oga. identity politics &amp; narrative was set by Islamists, they think death is fine for satire &amp; depiction of muhammad tell me more about my country o.. You Nigerian? Lebanese? Arab? Stayed anywhere apart from lag? There have already been discussions on twitter about this. The general consensus is that racism is to blame. that Moorhouse is nice hotel. Over priced though. insurgencies fueled by different undertones. Big difference I know? you say ""they"" as if it's one set of dudes in bond lair somewhere. lol.. sure as if Boko weren't an outspurt of the dire corruption &amp; resource hoarding. Illiterate. you seem to have bought knowledge from the traffic jam book sellers. Go away dude. no, I say they as Islamists who must force others to follow their religion or get will kill, see PESHWARATTACK hahaha answer my question. Have you been anywhere in Nigeria apart from ikoyi? Ignorant buffon lol answer my question. Where else in Nigeria have you been to? Know any Nigerian? Hmm? but they aren't  one set of blokes in a room. Are they? Speaking as someone  who has friens targeted  by that attack no, they are fascists, fascists who must impose religion on others, killing to enforce their religious edicts is a symptom facism is a modern phenomena though as is the revisionism of some of these groups modern?! Did you forget the dark ages? they are a modern phenomenon. Part of the reaction to modernity. its a revisionist movement to some extent.  Began late 19th and early 2pth century have you heard of the ridda wars? buddy. Don't  educate me on history  when you are unaware  of the epistemology of current movements fascism is nothing new, fascists existed throughout history, religion is the best tool fascism is early 20th c political  movement I wouldn't attempt to educate anyone who thinks fascism is a new thing or ignores ridda wars as evidence now you're  just using hyperbole &amp; rhetoric obviously  becuase its wrong. Fascism is a specific term for a early 20th century  movement. Any other use is just rhetoric",0
Not in our name ‚Äì Muslims respond in revulsion to #CharlieHebdo shooting.  http://t.co/KFfhprXNFb," actions speak louder than words. thank you glad you published that hun. Too often Muslims I know get unfairly accused of not speaking out. They are, but voices not heard Best thing Muslims can do is support for liberal values by actively proclaiming the right of Charlie Hebdo to publish cartoons Absolutely &amp; Loudly RT: Not in our name ‚Äì Muslims respond in revulsion to CHARLIEHEBDO shooting. Any word from the Immans condemning the attack yet? No thought not. This is a stupid comment. Muslims do condemn these attacks. You don't have to look hard either. Not seeing or hearing it, I'm afraid. I dearly wish to. I see no marchers shouting 'not in our name', for example. Why do you expect them to march? Iraq/Gaza etc is political activism for the British govts attn. No need here. just to replicate what the lefties in Britain did in defence of Islamic communities in Iraq, say? Would be a start. eg Peshawar Attack. British Muslims condemned that. No protest reqd; British govt had no influence or involvement Indeed, and rightly so. But it was on 'their' soil. Let's see how they react in France this evening. What are you referring to? I already addressed the point of the Iraq/Gaza protests which Muslims took part in. not here in USA! Our president says ISIL is not Islamic! It is in their name for the Love of God! If i set up Christian State, it won't, by default, make my actions consistent with Christian beliefs. Condemnation easy, insufficient. Explanation? Prevention? But the leaders of the muslim community are obvious by their absence....... as usual.... That's not the point. Re-read my comment. YES , BECAUSE ISLAMISTS ONLY DO WHAT NORMAL MUSLIMS TELL THEM TO DO, RIGHT?... sadly tom the majority don't seem to be rushing to condemn Are you expecting a joint press release from 1.6bn people? Twat! Right in there with a right hook. Lmao. you toss em up and I'll just brainlessly splat them! Typical. No coherent response. I doubt you did understand it, with literacy like that. Fuck off with your stupid shit. Thanks. Bye. There's nothing to respond to. You didn't understand my comment then proceeded to talk shit. GTFO. Can you VOTEFORNESHA by clicking this link? She's in a Scholarship Contest.THANK YOU &amp; GOD BLESS! No, you referred to the name of IS. You didn't respond to my Christian State point, in reply. Yours was a weak, bullshit point. It does have a place. It's reserved for  stupid cunts. I'm not! If you're going to judge me by a picture that's nowhere near inappropriate, then your vote is not needed!Goodbye ma'am!‚ò∫Ô∏èüôè No. How is it okay to mock someones religion in the name of freedom of speech?!Its not acceptable for any religion No, it is acceptable to mock all religions. In the West, no one is forced to practice any religion. Your second point doesn't relate to you openly suggesting how it is 'acceptable' to mock all religions Is you want to talk about the West, we're unable to mock ppls skin colour openly as its classed offensive So we can't cause offence to ones skin but can on their personal beliefs in the name of free speech.  Hell no Unlike religion, you are somewhat forced to practice your own skin colour . . . Analogy is still the same. You wouldn't dare to go up to a dark skinned person and call him.. black n****r so and so and proclaim its your right of speech But can mock their personal belief via different means It's perfectly acceptable to mock voluntarily accepted extremist ideology. Essential, actually. Mocking the colour of someone's skin is an affront to arbitrary genetic differences. You'v jus created tht ideology and directing it 2 Islam as whole forgetting th point in discusion Mockery of any ones religion is NOT acceprable. Be it Islam, Christianity etc etc Its still a form of freedom of speech. Freedom of speech as a whole shouldn't be subjected then Concessions shouldn't be made if the world wants to adopt a wider sense of open and free speech",0
Assange: The world must now avenge Charlie Hebdo by swiftly republishing all their cartoons. Censorship attacks are a losing move.," WHY pour OIL on Troubled Waters?  Common-Sense is NOT Censorship.  CHARLIEHEBDO it said ""republish"" Which furthers my point. The cartoons are very much accessible. Even now. You believe that's what this is about? Buh bye THEDAYIUNFOLLOWEDWIKILEAKS don‚Äôt feel bad I think they have bece irrelevant ""Censor the cartoons"" says 'free to say so' bwah. Who the fuck cares what Julian Assange has to say about this or anything anymore? to be fair, wikileaks do have a point, otherwise you let the terrorists win. Others are saying and doing just that. We don‚Äôt need to hear it from or from someone hiding in the Ecuadorean embassy. Maybe I misjudged Julian. haha I'm gonna take a wild guess and say you don't like Julian Assange for some reason :P Great idea. You can start. When will WIKILEAKS publish the cartoons? Why would I dislike a self-aggrandising anti-democratic ego maniac with a messiah complex accused of molesting women? oh he's a dick, I can't say I'm against WikiLeaks however (which is bigger than Assange) or whistleblowing. if is bigger than Assange why are they still acting as his mouthpiece? Why is there no new leadership? first of all there's no need to be so agressive towards me :P secondly I don't know, I'm not a member :P but the purpose of whistleblowing/transparency I support :P Sorry I didn‚Äôt intend to be aggressive towards you personally. So do I. But not the absolutism of transparency which Assange preaches. Most people agree there needs to be some level of secrecy around diplomacy for example. It often avoids conflict. he is not hiding, he is saving his life... Oh please. Easier for US to deport him from UK than from SE. They can't whilst he's in that Embassy though, well they could but it'd cause a crisis. But they could of without even trying to get him to Sweden. Hold on WheelieBin .. EVERY Freedom has a Price = my PRICE is reading YOUR Drivel .... until I turn you off!  :o) Me too. I am sure that the cartoons are copyrighted fool. Telling WL to publish them wd be asking them to commit a crimnal offence. ROFL, you think ASSNGE is worried about ""copyright"" after publishing quater million cables ? WIKILEAKS Any excuse to back away from his own exaltation. Are you for real ? ASSANGE makes a living out of publishing stolen information. You are one nutcase. WIKILEAKS Yes I am for real and yes a self declared holier then holy ""truthteller"" such as Sandra sdn`t ask .. ANY1 to committ a crimnal offence. But the dumba.ss is u since ur obviously not aware that the Guardian and others made millions with ... publishing and using yes the SAME STOLEN info. You admit ASSANGE publishes stolen info and bitches like a clown when WIKIEAKS is asked to retweet cartoon? ROFL LOL what did I tell u about u critisizing WHATEVER JA does NO MATTER$ what? U critisize him when he tweets about his ... legal case+u critisize him when he addresses other matters... Whatever he does in YOUR mind its ALWAYS wrong. Go figure. I wrote that the Guardian and others profitted from publishing stolen info. Can`t u read? Obviously not. +sorry to disappoint u but I am not qualified as a clown LOL. U and Sandra said that WL sd PUBLISH ALL cartonns. Can`t u not even remember ur own tweets? No1 talked about REtweeting fool. Since when has copyright prevented ASSANGE from publishing such information? Same is said for stolen information If anyone ever required confirmation of your hypocrisy, then they need look no further than this tweet. ASSANGE Is it really too much to ask from u to actually READ tweets first BEFORE u reply hm? Obviously. I said that I find it strange that the self declared holier then holy asks sb to commit a crimnal offence.Clear? Even u sd be able to grasp that old man. BTW when it comes to publishing stolen info then the MSM walk Hand in Hand with WL since they .. ,,,LITERALLY were their media partners....in publishing stolen info. Clear? if UK captures him they will send Julian to USA, ¬°may be directly to Guant√°namo! fucking gringos. U obv.or else u wdn`t have bothered to comment. Yawn.",0
The #CharlieHebdo assassinations suggest that anyone who has offended or challenged #Islamism is now at potential risk of being murdered," We know, Peter. But what do you think about that? We‚Äôve known that for years, Peter, surely. and its only now that you are realizing this ?? not islamism Peter - Islam - your choice of words highlights part of the cause used to think u were a twat...then watched u standing up for rights across the spectrum of life and u have changed me, thanks You are a patron of Tell Mama, islamophobia propagandists. Fiyaz Mughal's attacks of secularism and free speech don't help. welcome to the real world Tatchell! But question is how long this inhuman act will go on and we all will be tolerating. I used to understand your passion for free speech, Peter. Tell Mama and Fiyaz Mughal cause division. you can challenge and debate but you can't be grossly offensive like the paper &amp; they HATE gays too!!! At least 12 killed in shooting at office of French satirical:  PARIS Charlie Hebdo TONGUEINCHEEK do they? Yes Phil, the real deal muslims do!!! Gay muslims go against what islam says &amp; teaches!!! I know Tony,hence the TONGUEINCHEEK ;-) what do you mean ""now""? It was and is ever thus Good for you :) Is that why you say Islamism rather than simply Islam? Fear of murder? Please email me examples with links. Peter.org Thanks Thank you. I do my bit, as do many others. Best wishes The two are different. Islam is a religion. Islamism is a political ideology that wants a religious dictatorship They are different. Islam is a religion. Islamism is a political ideology that wants a religious dictatorship I've been campaigning against Islamism for 20 years. I never saw my critics challenge Qaradawi etc I've been campaigning against Islamism for two decades. I oppose it, while also defending Muslims against victimisation The two are different. Islam is a religion. Islamism is a political ideology that wants a religious dictatorship they shouted allah akbar and the prophet has been avenged - seems you are playing smoke and mirrors 1,000 cars torched - police man attacked - strangled - Jews fleeing France in record numbers - car jihad - Toulouse Islam is a proselytising religion. Whilst moderate Muslims are all well and good, we can still slowly become... a Muslim country without any terrorism. Just through sheer numbers and political influence. I don't want that. no, Peter.  What you wrote is true of critics of islam in general agreed G - but until they get the numbers - terror will do the job - middle east is good example no Christians in Mosul for first time in 2,000 yrs - Jewish and Chrisitan populations delclining throughout region including Turkey and N Africa - It's when they're given special status that ordinary ppl are pissed off. Ie. Burn Koran = Jail. Burn Bible = Not. Kill cartoonists - islamism - blame Islam - islamaphobic Didn't you also campaign for P.I.E?... Peter - you have a voice that is listened to - if you choose words because you are concerned about offending etc &gt; and not because you believe them or because they they will help us find the truth - then terror has won&gt; Only you will know - but I suspect your liberalism trumps your honesty Terror is winning, and will win, in my view. I agree that it is winning - appeasement is an example - but there are signs such as EDL PEDIGA etc and if our politicians, media, and others speak with truth and honesty then....&gt; the truth is not islamaphobic - and the journey to it should be encouraged Groups like that will be made illegal by Governments within the next 5-10 years, the larger they get. possible - their attempts to slander and vilify have proven inadequate - You sound like you support the murderers actions. Why not? Do cartoons offend you? What right do you have to dictate what is ""grossly offensive""? I find murder to be the key issue here. You can choose to engage or not, but they can be as offensive as they damn well want. That vile cartoon was grossly offensive. How can a cartoon ""offend"" an adult? NoThey can't! Why do you hate freedom of speech? Yes.They can. Its easy! FUCKISLAM Hoping every newspaper in the world publishes 1 of those cartoons on their front page tomorrow. I'll dumb it down for you: You insult someone's faith with a vile cartoon &amp; print nationwide. Does it look pretty or ugly? Say WHO? says who? being offended is a choice not a right. fuck the prophet. oeps I did it again... Well Tit-for-tat. Haters gonna get hate. Oh and Fuck You! :) I am flattered by your offer, but you aren't my type. Sorry mate. So you never replied: Do you support the murderers actions? Its a yes or no question. calling for murder on homo's &amp; lesbo's is offensive but i am not gonna shoot you for it That's a fine comparison. Cartoons &lt;=&gt; murder. Some blokes will never dig it. Satire is not hatred. Learn the difference! It was offensive! In fact the controversial paper has been prosecuted for racism &amp; incitement of hatred. Stop sympathising. Still waiting for your reply. You support the murderers action, yes or no? If indeed it is found guilty of racism, then it will receive a fitting punishment. That does not excuse cold-blooded murder! It doesn't matter what it looks like, it doesn't justify murder. Or should I ""dumb it down for you"". Murder apologist prick. Peter, I don't trust Tell Mama. That is partly why I provided a link. Everyone else can read it. You don't need to reply. You will have heard much of this before. The link has all of the details you require. Much of that is old. has changed considerably in the last year. Not in my view. Tell Mama still pushes Islamophobia propaganda on Twitter. Mughal's views haven't changed on secularism. This is from 2 January 2015. Fiyaz Mughal on censorship on social media. His views haven't changed Tell me how Tell Mama it has changed, Peter? I've read their Twitter feed for some time. Did you want it to change? Take a look at their recent statements on their website. Of course, I encourage and support such change Tell Mama website is part of the problem. The feedback page still features former indulged 'pal' Mo Ansar. No change there. Do you think their 'Islamophobia' led strategy was misguided? Divisive? Did you ask for a new approach? It hasn't worked. If social media posts harass or threaten violence against Muslims, they should be removed. They are crimes I sometimes disagree with regarding where they draw the line. They are evolving. I have to start work now. The police deal with crimes. Did Tell Mama report JihadistJoe for being 'offensive'. Do you condone that, 'if' they did? Maybe you can work on Tell Mama supporting free speech rather than writing doublespeak website attacks on secularism. Would Tell Mama draw the line if a satirist declared, ""Islam Nazis"" Is this a crime against Muslims? Tell Mama UK haven't changed, they are worse than ever. They should never get public funds again. Incorrect, Islam is both a religion and a political ideology worse than fascism. Islamism is a PC term. If not stopped, Islam will turn Europe into the Middle East. It‚Äôs happening too fast to ignore any longer. Tatchell has also persistently campaigned to ban homophobic reggae music. I've NOT campaigned to ban homophobic reggae music; only music that incites VIOLENCE against gays &amp; others Inciting violence is an IMMINENT thing, like handing someone a gun &amp; yelling ""SHOOT"": Encouraging the prosecution of music for ""inciting violence"" is a VERY dangerous slippery slope. If reggae can ""incite violence"", then so can just about any gangsta rap song. I HIGHLY doubt you'd consider it ""inciting violence"" if the lyrics called for violence against homophobes. Under Brandenburg v. Ohio, the mere ADVOCACY of violence is free speech. Should Ice T have been arrested for singing ""Cop Killer""? What about ""I Shot the Sheriff""? They are not direct incitements &amp; were not followed by killings (which did occur in Jamaica) Direct incitement would be the US standard of imminent lawless action. I can think of numerous songs that directly encourage the killing of cops. Also, you're using the same logic as people who blame heavy metal and hip-hop for murder. Jamaican rights groups confirm rise in anti-gay attacks after release of 'kill gays' songs Several groups have stated that gang violence rises due to gangsta rap too. Freedom of speech is not outcome-dependent. Speech can't MAKE people do anything. The law is a blunt instrument. Give it the power to ban music &amp; that power WILL be abused. Muhammed cartoons are said to cause violence too. Argument can be used to censor anything. Advocating violence is a serious criminal offence in the UK and most countries. People like Tatchell never consider that censorship they advocate could be used against them. Let Peter declare 'Islam Nazis' in Cairo. Test tolerance. Oh, I forgot, it's only incitement when a satirist or non-lefty says it, right? He'd have no problem with songs about killing homophobes. I guarantee it. Peter supports Fiyaz Mughal. Tell Mama, Faith Matters -  and their dodgy blasphemy doublespeak. Placard was at rally against Islamist fanatics, not against Mulsims in general Did Tell Mama report  JIHADISTJOE?  JESUISCHARLIE JIHADISTJOE said he is not against muslims in general. sad thing is, Muslims in general would condemn u for being gay Bible &amp; Quran call for death to gays. Should we ban them? Speaking of which, 1st Amendment protects right to preach jihad. ban who? In London, bigoted Muslims harassed Peter for gay rights walk. organised religion is bad Muslims call for death to gays WAY more than any Nazis do. BIGOTS hide behind their religion/beliefs 2justify their hatred If someone thinks gays should die, I want them... to make those views known so the public knows who to avoid. Exactly. We need to know who the enemy is. Ur politically correct stunted anti-Tatchell driven reflects your dwarf withered mind Peter sticks his head above the Parapet in public. He is a very brave man. I agree.",0
"We condemn today's horrific attacks in #Paris. Our condolences and support go to the people of France, the victims, and their families."," So what is the ""root cause"" of this?

"That oil-hungry #CharlieHebdo with its murderous foreign policy. 

#religionofpeace"," What? is a vocal ex-Muslim atheistWe need MANY more like him I So Agree if you can't see that he's being sarcastic in saying a satirical publication is oil-hungry, get off Twitter Read my feed &amp; watch your assumptions. The problem is Islam, not everyone with a name like mine. No, he‚Äôs an atheist. What part of ‚Äúhe‚Äôs an atheist‚Äù are you struggling with? Bro u got the wrong guy....LOL , you handled that with more grace than I could have. Bravo to you. Mr Stone I'm afraid you totally missed this gentleman's point So were the cartoonists sire. Does a moderate Muslim understand that? Anyways thanks for the gyaan unkil. Haha, someone clearly doesn't follow you. &lt;--- isn't a Muslim. Actively preaches against religion. Learn to read Austin, u ignorant derp both u r taking same extremist positions. Kill this kill that. We r all humans n no body has a right to kill Critique the mindset not the person...&amp; do not threaten people at all certainly not on the basis of ethnicity u should change ur name to vile pig, before u r nailed for mistaken identity. Keep Safe Ali ... Dude, he's not defending Islam I didn't say to kill anyone, ever. False equivalency in the name of ""moderation""? Just B Human Nothing Else. that's an amazing response IMPRESSED that tweet you quoted was a perfect example of where two extremes meet. I'm disgusted by this. 2B reasonable re Islam is 2B flanked both on left (""religion has NOTHING 2 do w/ violence!"") &amp; right (""kill the brown ppl!"") Does Allah Justify this Killing? day has come near when u will asked in grave ""who is ur lord""? u won't have answers &amp; be doomed blasphemy &amp; apostasy are grave crimes &amp; they deserve serious punishments but can you please answer me? I don't want to burn in hell. so they should be killed? indeed, that is what they deserve. but if Islam is wrong? How do you know that Allah even exist? What if Jesus or Ram is real instead? how peaceful! why selective ? go worship ram &amp; Jesus together &amp; hope 1 of them is real. yes, but they contradict. So we can't follow all. So kindly tell me how is Islam better? ZEROTOLERANCETOBLASPHEMY. nobody was killed until  they insulted our faith. then follow any1 u feel is better. but how does someone insulting your faith make any difference as long as you are on Allah's path? but don't you ask such a question to people who told you to follow Allah? u can question Islam but can't insult it. there is a line u should not cross. ZEROTOLERANCETOBLASPHEMY followng Islam is my personal choice. &amp;u too shud follow ur 5000yrs old systm of superstitions. okay. Islam has no superstition? no there are no superstitions OK. One more thing, Why are men allowed to marry 4 women? u can marry only1. it is not an obligation but just an option if u can do justice.&amp; it is betr thn doing rapes. but why aren't women given the same privilege? Why are men allowed in the first place? if ur wife were married to 3 other ppl &amp; becomes pregnant. who would take responsibility of being its father? no, but why should my 1st wife take responsibility if 3 other wives children either? We are allowed to insult Nazism but not Islam? No special privileges! ~The answer is Thor isn't it. who told u to insult it? I did not. I won't complain if Nazis kill you for insulting them. oh you wouldn't? Now here's someone who wouldn't stand up to tyranny... I would if u don't insult them (Nazis). If you insult me and I punch you, who's to blame? indeed you, I'm a Muslim hence privileged. ""I'm a Muslim hence privileged."" wow, what the fuck???? You are just a human being like me You are an utter fool, part of a separate problem we need to eradicate. how dare you call me ""human being like me"" are you for real? it's not an insult. you can choose to answer what u want, but u will b asked of this certainly .",0
12 shocking #CharlieHebdo covers from Muhammad to Michael Jackson http://t.co/sT93i3WTWi http://t.co/flEmCiRds2," regardless of circumstance, I think it is wrong to republish offensive caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. click bait! Satirizing ridiculous, violent religious beliefs is not ""shocking"".  The beliefs themselves are shocking. why? because they are crass, Islamophobic and serve only to inflame tensions. Have some respect. Why? The problem is with the people that take offense. They are clearly mentally unstable. the offended have the problem. They could choose not to be. absolutely wrong. It is codified in Islam that depictions of God or the Prophet are forbidden. the cartoons are designed to be as provocative as possible, as you are well aware. and the bigger man is not provoked Got shock? Cuz it ain't here. people really need to get a grip. All religion deserves ridicule. Sorry, but it is exactly the circumstances that warrant it--we don't want to be intimidated into silence. the 'bigger man' doesn't create or publish this type of trash in the first place. 2 wrongs don't make a right. But we're not muslim. Don't you get that? Tensions are extremely high and the cartoons are offensive. This is a time to talk peace, not share provocations. It's religion. it's ridiculous - it deserves to be ridiculed. There really is no need for imaginary friends As I said, mentally unstable to kill non-muslims for doing something that the are not forbidden to do. So shove this where the sun doesn't shine ... uh huh, but it is not irrational as u claimed to be offended by them. And I take issue with the insensitivity. And this ... Except satire, unlike men with automatic weapons, is not an act of non-peace. you're a racist, Islamophobic moron. You and the terrorists are 2 sides of the same coin. Blocked. And, should I close my twitter account should someone find that women speaking their mind is 'offensive'? hate speech isn't an act of peace. I'd call u a bully but ur not, ur just the buillies' laugh-along sidekick. Nope. I'm just asking people to be considerate of the world's 1 billion+ Muslims &amp; not share those cartoons. Lots of people are offended by a lot of different things--do you eat pork? are you going to stop soon? Satire is not hate speech. And how is a guy with a pen more of a bully than a guy with a gun? no, but I don't go and stick a photo of me eating a bacon sandwich on my neighbour's door. I never said he was. But I'm glad you can recognise their similarities. And how would that be satire? Again, satire &lt;&gt; hate speech/provocation. it wouldn't be as offensive as publishing a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad. What similarities?You must be trolling. You really want to compare being 'offended' to being savagely killed? Not really. But what I'm saying is the killings don't retrospectively justify the provocations. The point is, no one has the right to kill/silence you for being offensive (unless they win a fair lawsuit). But the entire point of satire IS being provocative. Banning 'offensiveness' is banning free speech.Gotta go. think I missed the joke on the lawsuit bit, but otherwise I completely agree with you there. ok now I get it, they can silence you if they win a lawsuit. Not kill you though! not sure about banning it, but just because something's legal doesn't make it moral. But offensiveness IS NOT and CAN NOT be the measure of morality.Ugly world that would be: where would it end? not saying nothing should ever be offensive, I'm saying caricaturing the Prophet is way over line of acceptability. Why? what makes Mohammed (or any other prophet) so special? My point exactly: Evolution is 'way over the line of acceptability' for creationists, should we stop teaching it? It's not the same. Criticising Islam is 1 thing, publishing caricatures of Muhammad is a no-no. Sorry I was unclear there. I'm not saying never be offensive, but those cartoons are way way too far. You still haven't explained why we should care about Muslim no-nos (more than creationst no-nos?). it's a dumb comparison What is? Please answer, why should we give a damn what Muslims find offensive? or any other religious group? Nobody forces Muslims to read Charlie Hebdo, why should freedom of speech be limited on their account? Cos they're human beings &amp; there's no need to be a douche? Ur a bigot, no better than a high school bully.",0
"I would think a religious figure is more offended by savage, barbaric slaughter in his name than by a cartoon. #charliehebdo"," Hence the difference between ""religion"" and savage death cult following a child raping maniac Not that religion.... Not the particular religious figure in this case. He was down with this sort of thing. Barack Obama created ISIS, Dana. No one will acknowledge this but the Egyptian and Lebanese governments. The video from Oct. where U.S. military train ISIS is here. Watch and see USAID everywhere. if you're going to have a banner of Reagan, then talk conspiracy shit, you're a hypocrite. Oh dear sir, considering the Soviets also did the same and then also funded chemical weapons to Iraqi Kurds? I suppose you would support the Soviet Union doing it since they were as far to the left as you were. And since Iraq was not obligated to follow the Geneva Protocol of 1925 after they abstained, where is your support for? The never blinked because you had no power to stop what Saddam did in Iraq. Carter created the Ayatollah, buddy. The rise of Islamic terrorism is on Carter, and this mess is one you. Now, where are you, you little hypocrite? Where is your condemnation of ISLAMOPHOBIA when you just posted that meme? yeah, gotta get your own pet terrorists. You are too cowardly to fire back at me, or how should I say it, to condemn the Soviet Union since you support communism. no dickhead. I wouldn't have supported backwards, women killing, acid-throwing maniacs. Yes, I do, You voted for him, and he is in the OVALOFFICE at your satisfaction. Carter created the Ayatollah? Not the US backing the Shah while he raped Iran? your history is totally fucked. The US took in the Shah after being warned not to. A pig of a dictator The hell you do, because you party does by supporting unconditionally the Islamist movement. You funded Hamas. You funded Hamas; you funded and created Boko Haram. Obama is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and you are a damn liar. no shitfuck. It started w  Reagan, followed w Bush Sr, Clinton kept it going, Bush Jr just blew it all up Apparently, you do support Islamic jihad, else you would know that Iran was nearly westernized during the Shah. But at least Carter and Reagan had the cold war to blame their stupidity on You support jihad; you likely support the genocidal Saddam Hussein, who was manufacturing WMDs in the 1970s under Carter. I'm no Islamaphobe, but I detest Jihadis and ANY religious fundamentalists. Even your ""pet"" ones You supported the Soviet expansion into Afghanistan and its role in attempting to establish a stronghold in Iran. it's people like you that feed the beast. Keep picking sides w zero knowledge or perspective. Stupid, crass ignorance If the Shah was a dictator, than why are you sitting there supporting Khomeini? Why are you sitting there revising history? no, you dim fuck. Saying Reagan was stupid to do business w the Taliban and Jihadis doesn't equal loving communism twit I'm firing back sissy Where is your evidence, Robbie? If you are so brilliant like an astute Marxist is, why do you like jihadists? ISIS? I'm Canadian. We just have to suffer for your sniveling arrogance. Asswipes Where is that multicultural B.S. you just spat at me, only now you are U-Turning because you cannot handle losing badly? you're a fucking idiot. Keep tongue-kissing the House of Saud, wonder where terrorist money comes from. you're a tinfoil hat wearing racist fool that is part of the reason for the spread of radical Islam. That's on YOU I don't give a damn who you are; you're not an American. Keep your dysfunction North of me supporting parliament's attacks. lmao, if you call a brutal, homicidal dictatorship ""westernized"". Read a fucking book moron and given all sorts of chemical weapons to fight Iran by the US. Then ignored while using them to kill Kurds When in doubt, you always pull the RACECARD out. And if I am a racist, that is a compliment from a Nazi eugenicist. yet when he was a toothless, beaten memory, you fucks go in and kill a few hundred thousand civilians. Smart I do read. Apparently, you spend time on your Little Red Bookj to grasp what non-revisionism actually is. no you fucking idiot. But I sure as shit didn't support misogynistic, raping imbeciles instead. He may have died of Alzheimer's but you as a socialist would love to have fund him on your taxpayer's tip. Hypocrite. wish I didn t have to suffer for what moronic, drooling conservative Americans cause in the world. Disgusting Too bad so sad he saved the West from communism; blame Bush 41 on Afghanistan. it's possible to not support wither, but to support the people. You support the Shah, know NOTHING about him And you still have never once addressed why you support jihad over Saddam or Khomeini since you support authority by force. this just shows your catastrophic ignorance. Mental midget You mean like you love Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew? Ted Kennedy and JFK? Rapists, murderers and child sex traffickers? Of course you are getting off track, but you are so incompetent at winning what you started you have to steer clear. you're not French, so you can shut your fucking fat yap about anything that happens in Europe then. try readin books that don't have cartoons in them dipshit I don't give a damn if the Shah was evil; you still support jihad, and you are admitting this while denying riding a fence. Kit-Kats 4 everyone RT: Too bad so sad he saved the West from communism; blame Bush 41 on Afghanistan. You stand for nothing but absolute power and as Mao stated, your power is had at the barrel's end of the leftists' guns. lmao, saved the West from communism? Get off the meth fool I support leaving nations to determine their own futures. I support safe zones and international efforts Then why are you complaining about American presidents 30 years gone by? Why complain about Khomeini when he is Persian? : Truth is, ""progressives"" historically side w/the most anti-western component. History proves this. Why do you exist only to serve as the bane of the universe? You oppose any variety of peace in favor of class warfare. I support  US and French weapons suppliers not making billions off phony wars that inspire jihadism I support people having some fucking knowledge before they spout off about things. well, I love Pierre Trudeau, was fond of Jack Layton. Big fan of Joe Clark (he was Conservative too). but not to worry, your ignorance of world affairs shows all you read is RW blogs and TMZ. Sad and pitiful It sure wasn't Gorbachev who ended the Cold War. He was bullied for years by Yeltsin, who was as drunk as you are blind. of course you don't care. Typical Since Jimmy Carter seded Western superiority in the 1970s to  the Kremlin, you would be only too happy to have a red flag. nowhere have I stated this. Your revisionism starts quickly. Adjust that tinfoil hat fool false. Most of the rebels progressives support are very pro-West, just not pro-conservatism. Big difference Oh, you mean like Canada's role in West Africa with Boko Haram? Oh God, what would you do if jihad couldn't spread? you can try to pretend the ""West"" is just ppl that echo your beliefs. Arrogant and prideful nonsense Enjoy that Canadian bacon and your slice of humble pie since you never provided squat to support your lies. Adieu! : Unfortunate for your position, history disagrees with you. they spent themselves into irrelevancy. Much like the US is doing to combat an enemy they keep creating you seem to feel 'twas only the US that opposed the USSR. Also odd that you'd think I'd want any other leaders than Cdn guess what dipshit, other country's citizens are every bit as patriotic as Americans. Perhaps more so and what do you think Canada's role is you know-nothing fool? no, you do. Don't confuse your myopia for history. Owned. : So ruhollah khomeini was pro west? Are you a dumbass? Apparently, the Canadian trogalodyte is still walking like an Egyptian and hung over from his binder last night. never said that. Sovereign nations owe no duty to be ""pro-west"". Are you pro-middle east? what ghastly arrogance you have. : So being correct is the new arrogance. NOTED lmfao. You dolt. You spelled troglodyte wrong. Fucking moron : And you get history wrong. Your point? Wow. A grammar Nazi. Apparently, you are far more than just an anti-Semite Nazi or an advocate of eugenics. Thank you are a canuck up in the land of the Edmund Fitzgerald.

Not a man who died ages ago and a whole religion! now you're deciding who talks about what.

Smite the infidels where u find them......belief that doesn't cause harm....not buying sorry. don't. Have a nice day tho :) they didn't make fun. they criticized. it's called freedom of speech and critical thinking you stupid criticism in an offensive way is macking fun. Just like if I say 'that girl is fat'. That is not criticising in some cultures saying that girls is fat is a compliment.Whatever they criticised every religion+ it's offensive when you're brainwashed and you don't know the meaning of satire. but only muslims got offended. And even now some of them are trying to defend terrorists. 'that girl is fat' is criticism btw. you're criticizing her weight. are you serious???? You just gave excuse for bullying in name of criticism! Jesus. BYE. wtf loool. You have no tolerance for bullying but killing people in name of belief is okay? then they are pathetic muslims who lack Islam. And I got offended by shooting more than the cartoon LMFAO üòÇwhere did I give excuse to extremism??? Bye dude those cartoons are not made to offend people but to make them think. too bad most are too narrow minded to get it then they should make fun of extremism not the whole belief. Too bad you are with bullying so you don't care. üëã cause no harm, I just saw today. I have EVERY right to mock your beliefs. You believe in a flying horse FFS.

Are you even muslim? how is making fun of my prophet a freedom speech? U disgust me. you believe in gods. That makes you a fool. I do not justify extremism and I don't justify disrespect. U r free to bark alone now yes I'm but I believe in the religion of Muhammad not the transformed Islam nowadays. since I don't have a dictionary nearby I'll just 'bully' you and say 'you're stupid, I really feel sorry for you' you are disrespecting my belief but it is OK cause you it has 0 affect on me you know, people died and you are still trying to find middle ground. the same mohammed that raped his 9yo wife? You follow him? of course it's ok - no belief is beyond ridicule - esp religious fairy tales. and those who died I feel terribly bad for their parents and I so hope whoever did that crime feels pain LMAO no Mohammed did not do that.

Emiliano Zapata said it during the Mexican Revolution  there's more on it search it. He probably got it from Zapata Interesting. Lots of references to Camus, since it was in his book. i grew up listening to this all my life and Emiliano Zapata was known for this. ""prefiero morir de pie que vivir siempre arrodillado"" he said it while leading a revolution against Porfirio Diaz Interesting that Camus had used it and nothing I see makes the connection. That is interesting Thanks for pointing it out. It's a quote I've remembered for more than 30 years.

If trie He/she needs to pay more attention. Meant TRUE OBVS god is logic not a sex not according to my local parish priest. Islamic extremists. Not Islam. They are different entities and shouldn't be casually associated. Terror has no religion no, they won't. they are dead and gone and will be forgotten. like so many killed before. Well said! priests are gay Trouble is low information ppl can't make distinctions because that requires thought and even study. Islam must stop the extremists hiding within them. Until all of Islam condemns this, all of Islam is guilty. afraid coffee drinker that is as misleading as blaming every Christian for crusades of for Troubles at the time of the crusades they were supported by the entire Christian world. Your point is? hang on! Many in christian world didnt know about them. &amp; Troubles? Sweeping generalisation dangerous. try reading some of the Islamic doctrine, they have no space for multiculturalism. and you do? totally yes. That is why I am weary of a religion that is only interested in dominating History will show people like you as the apologists that permitted genocide Are you are suggesting that there are complex, possibly interdependent, factors at play. We want simple answers Mary! Extremists are responsible, not Islam. It is irresponsible of you to conflate the two. Think! Do you really not see that ""peaceful Islam"" is enabling Islamic terrorists? WAKE UP! surely the vast majority of muslim condemn such events anyway e.g. I can only applaud the Muslim funeral directors of Australia for their stance. Mary your an educated woman. Most Islamic states would never have permitted you an education. Think! before demanding ""where's the condemnation?"" check if it isn't there already. Whilst many Imams preach hatred and support for 9/11 and 7/7 I will demand condemnation. OK? condemn extremists but do not casually condemn a very broad and large religion. my point is that a large religion is supporting extremists and needs to give them up. you're equating the extremists with an entire religion. That is wrong. If the religion supports the extremists and the evidence shows it does then no I am not. I think that you need to really look at the global aims of Islam. you are creating a monolithic strawman. For example, Al-Azhar has condemned attack. no I am just amazed that so many are sleepwalking into the Islamification of Europe. let's stay on topic. You were making sweeping statements about a broad religion. trivial to find Islamic leaders/groups condemning extremists, but you overlook this. how do you defend a group that support slavery, subjugation of women and death to non-muslim take your lazy soft wet liberal views and ram them up your rectum. Michael I suggest you go and live somewhere that Sharia law is practiced for a while. when you realise just how 2nd class and worthless you are as a non muslim then make comments obviously your insults don't debunk my statements, nor justify lazy generalisations. and your simpering liberalism, whilst delightful just makes you look wet and infective but back on point do you support slavery and child sex like Islam does? do you support the subjugation of women and the desire to kill or convert all non Muslims? I condemn extremism, criminal activity, human rights abuses &amp; sweeping generalisations. So you do condemn Islam. Thank you and good night.",0
"Why Muslims should embrace free speech, even if it includes insults to their Prophet http://t.co/S12EYrY2Qs #CharlieHebdo"," you mean why extremists* should. No, all Muslims seriously?you participate in the narrative of muslim barbarity that need to catch up with western enlightenment ideals?weak. Muslims embrace freedom of speech. The terrorists that attacked Charlie Hebdo clearly don't, and they are not Muslims. I didn't say they didn't, but I think many would balk at idea of allowing insulting the prophet. I also don't think its useful or right to claim that anyone who does something wrong ""is not a Muslim"" works. You clearly didn't read till the end weren't not allowed to tell you to stop insulting our leader? So I'm allowed to insult the Pope in front of you and you can call it freedom of speech? you obviously haven't studied Islam and the definition of a Muslim. Muslims don't murder people, it's against Islam. Read the article first please, I've addressed all that u make this about 'intolerant Muslims being easily offended',not larger colonial context of western destruction of Muslim life Please RT 1 thing that's always baffled me.Why is criticising Judaism anti semitism(crime ) &amp; criticising Islam freedom OS? embrace freedom of insult u mean? i agree with the right to reject other religion. But why the right to insult each other? Where is our morality? right free speech is especially important when its the right to insult Its not an insult to criticise Judaism, only to demonise Jews. Difference So you think colonialism made Muslims less tolerant of free speech? we speak out &amp; defend our prophet and our religion when they are offended. We don't resort to violence our offensive comments it's *not* bout freedom of speech.its about how these cartoons participate in centuries-old discourse that dehumanizes Muslims But the right to questioning the religion is indeed important. But not to insult. It will resulted in chaos right. ok now I'm confused :(;) I never seen any case muslims insult any religions jew, christian or anything there is no compulsion in religion, of course not. We also have limits to how and when we can defend our prophet and religion so I think this is a two way thing, they can insult, but we also can defend. You missed that part. I Didn't.Read it Properly You said we can be ""offended"", you did not say we can defend.JESUS CALM DOWN'S LIKE 15. what, and there aren't examples of imagery in Muslim countries that dehumanise others? how is that relevant? Reality check: people in most places dehumanise people different to them. so that makes it OK? but western countries far more tolerant to diversity than Arab or even South Asian countries I just don't understand how you want us to ""embrace"" freedom of speech, we already tolerate offensive comments... wow.i dont care.we are specifically talking about west.don't derail! you were the one trying to justify censorship b/c of colonialism i am not justifying anything.i want us to be more critical of the narrative presented to us n not participate in it,which u do the ""narrative"" isn't always about how Muslims are being haunted by colonialism. There are several issues at play here And the article mentions examples of Sikhs trying the same kind of censorship, which I also opposed at the time i agree.but i dont see the dominant one,which propagates fear n hatred of muslims,being criticized here I start with an image showing the racism that Asians faced in the past. Did you actually bother absorbing the piece...? or are you just arguing because that's what you like doing all day? but again,u make it about of freedom of speech,not about how Charlie participated in a broader culture that vilifies Muslims wow,personal attack.And that, sir, is *how* you silence people.censorship works in many different ways u know we're done here. Well done for not reading or understanding What do you think Islamophobia is all about?Not demonising?Hounding of Muslims by Police, not demonising? Islam does need defending ... we did not make it a monopoly of religion, you did. I'm not talking about religion in general. I'm focusing on Islam. Surely you can't be serious. its kinda pathetic that they need defending from cartoons after all these years- no?",0

AKA: Liberal given that you rewrite facts that seems to make sense. also, they absolutely did provoke. What world does this dipshit live in? dude, I have no idea. I guess he equivocates them to french people who did nothing but go to work. yea ok ... u started off...""i have no ideal"" lets keep it right there...smh (checkmate) saying they provoked no one is as ignorant as those chanting, ""hands up don't shoot"". It never happened. who did trayvon martian provoke ? and while i wait for the first answer that will never come...who did mike brown provoke ? who the hell is Trayvon Martin? Maybe he shouldn't have slammed a guys head into concrete? why is it that you as a black man take issue with accepting the consequences of your actions? Mike Brown death was tragic shouldn't have happened. He shouldn't have resisted but should have been handled and while i wait for the 2nd answer that wont be accurate..who did eric garner provoke ? differently. You try and turn it into a race issue which just makes you the racist. maybe zimmerman should have kept on driving...shrugs.. sorry, Eric Garner didn't provoke. Mike Brown sure as hell did Like I got ... yea keep driving and ignore the guy acting suspicious who was on drugs and out of place. Mike Brown deserves to be 6ft under. His ass had it coming for the way he acted. He initiated a fight u not out of place when u in your own hood.,,period... wasn't his. He was visiting his dad. He was acting suspicious and Z had every right to follow him as we now find out that witness 43 was never there...lol...if u shoot a unarmed kid...u a coward..period... if you attack a man with a gun you're a dumbass. Period. facts don't matter to you though. It's all about race. Not about responsibility. You'll get far. even when the police tells u not to...u follow anyway...lol... police didn't tell him not to. See... Facts buddy. They're important. facts say otherwise...real facts.. facts say that DISPATCH told him not to follow. Dispatch are not the police. They answer a phone. the 911 operator told him not to...check the facts.. oh sorry, you said the police. But of a difference. One has legal authority. One does not. FACTS remain that Z did not break the law during the altercation. He was attacked. Defended his life. bottom line...u shoot a kid with juice and skittles...lol he was a coward-as well as u-based on your comments I'm not defending Z. He's an idiot. But Trayvon was a bigger one. Turned it physical and got dealt with the code in the ""hood"" as you call it... Says, if you're gonna be a badass, you better be really bad. otherwise you're gonna end up in a body bag for thinking you're badder than you really are Muslim extremist love France. They are suffering from liberals like you ... LOL.... (LOL!) (LOL;) Mike Brown provoked the Store owner and the Cop he tried to kill. Everything isnt about black people you ignorant fuck Trayvon Martin attacked Zimmerman.  That is a fact that anyone who paid attention knows. Accurate?  There is concrete evidence that answers both of your questions!  CANTFIXSTUPID & lt; ---------------------- Zeroselfaaway Says who?  The embarrassing left    LMAO!!!!!  No wonder you are bottom class Maybe it was Bossip or sandra rose?  Class A journalism there!  LMAO!!!!  CANTFIXSTUPID SOSAD Like said.  You don't care about black lives.  You just hate white people zimmerman should have done what the 911 operator told him to do...which was stay in your car...but he saw a little boy- yea yea i know....thanks for reminding me...but I'm about to catch this flight...holla at u hoes... ha fat momma is the only hoe (Lolbit!)

I did not feel obliged to say. I just wanted to say. elbette... But in France everybody will be about asking each and every muslim to ""react"". Absolutely sickening. if this is true, please draw a cartoon of your own making of the prophet the radical people worship. CHARLIEHEBDO Well said sir. Now if we can just get a similar response from the other 1.6 billion Muslims...Thank you. CHARLIEHEBDO V condemn the killings.V wil request French Govt to investigate&amp; track the Terrosst&amp;thr Masterminds bullshit! All Muslims feel same way. Death to non believers.  u fuck face! I hope u meet the same level of evil as Islam is Good .If only all Muslims could ignore vast passages of their own book like yourself You have no idea about how good it is to read statements like yours! Mohammed was a killer and a pedo as are his followers.  Cult of evil!!!! fed up with NOTINMYNAME, NOTMINE... stop ! Would you dare to publish those cartoons in your paper? Ofcource not. Your condemnation is as hollow as believes. But are there different ""Islams""? or is it all one? because you conveniently reject the violence in Islamic scripture. These men do not. yes there is we Islams are murderers we mor try to find peace not war but there are some that are bad If you bothered to read his article you would find out why his comments are NOT hollow. Stupid comment n those bad ones will be judged in the end I'm only here to tell you not to fight back n start a war you now nothing about the prophet himself so shut up Read his article - his condemnation stands 100%. It doesn't rely on him actually drawing/publishing cartoons. Jeez If there was a God he'd appear to us all! Not some bloke in a cave! He'd bring peace not this evil pedo crap culd be false flag operation like 911 2 attack Muslim lands+character assassinate Islam+Muslims 4 oil+Israel but showing no reaction and your pov will cause people to make their own judgements, so this just helps them w/ that And Guess ... look why do you care huh this is our believe as Islams why do you care huh that can be any one, we should not conclude before investigation, like I said in the end all of us will be judge he created us every day in life is a challenge by him the almighty so if you don't believe he exist its us prob in the end he will only judge the good and the evil who despise him in ‚ÄúThe field of masyar"" I'm not asking.... you to believe,all I'm saying is the earth the galaxy is his belongings we only borrow it n in the end it will why ??

However I or no one can vouch for 1.6 Bn. did the Romans apologise? Or the north African slave traders. No?! Because ancient history. Idiot! Alright. So did all d Yankees apologised for their 10 yrs murderous war in Iraq or Afghanistan ? they were trying to help? Trying to free women from oppression.  And a murderous regime. Haha. Well, dey wer trying to help themselves by looting Oil for their consumerist Countrymen. yeah right! What they filled pockets with oil and went home? Idiot! I am nt justifyin 2days action bt painting1.6 bn wit d same brush is oversimplification n moronic Islam at its core is evil violent and encourages pedo behaviour.  U know that!

Are u so stupid u need something to believe? all you hear are just lies he was never any of those,those are just BS to make you people hate on him why do you bother,we never bother with any of your believe publicly but you bother us. one more thing if you actually pay attention to the true story of Islam mor than BSing it you might just know.. from YouTube actually and this little conversation is over,nothing you mock,BS will NVR make me give up islam.

Bombing is imprecise and many people there just live in fear.  I would love to see France do a mission which forcibly removed RAIF It wasn't serious.

"If you are not condemning the #Islamic ideology that killed 12 at #CharlieHebdo, your sympathy doesn't mean shit.
Support #FreeSpeech."," which oddly seems very racist to me given the size and composition of Islam Ask Greenwald and Affleck, they'll tell you how Islam is a race (because now you can convert to a race!)! So your using the same old tired excuse. Something original would be nice. Islam is not a race. no I'm saying exactly the opposite and mocking Affleck et al. It's very clearly not a race. They will call you racist! idgaf because I know I'm not and I have Muslim friends who are black, white, Arab, and Asian has Affleck's opinion changed at all since that appearance? Haven't heard anything since. amazing how someone still tries to pull out George Dubya Bush's arg of 'with us or against' Well as we have seen before, the faith of the killers in such incidents is relevant only if they r Muslims. Won't condemn Islam as Islam did not kill. it says verses in the book...nothing about mohammad. Me neither. Don't think so. Ben Affleck aint even a Good actor;) Is a mere man equal to God? It is not even logical to call that ""blasphemy"". race is a social construct it's not real so what is racist is nebulous. Condemning all Islam is racist yeah i know besides equating muhammad to allah would be shirk. Couldn't agree more aside from that being an absurd redefinition of ¬´race¬ª, who is condemning *all* of Islam ? certainly not me - at least no more so than I condemn all religions. But when drawings can get.. I think he was joking. 12 people killed and 8 injured, and that's not an isolated incident, there is a systematic problem. gah that's what I get for ¬´multitasking¬ª - just doing two things badly yes I seen a lot of Christians, Jews, atheists, agnostics, pagans etc etc killing in the streets It's relevant if it's WHY they're doing it! Anders Breivik was Christian. And he killed 77 people.But.....okay?? yes. And his religion was mentioned! SYDNEYSIEGE PESHAWARATTACK YAZIDIMASSACRE - SAME intent for all. Isolated? Mohammad's ass! When it's white people, they only do it because ""mental instability"" In EXACTLY the same way as when christian nutters attack abortion clinics. Funny how that works, isn't it? oh it's always white people to blame hey. *Checks world history book* Yup, pretty much oh you should check yours if that's what you've read. Hilarious :/ Religion is a mental instability. Also, no one hides the fact that xtians attack abortion clinics. your argument is invalid. your racism is pretty funny too Not a tough decision. I'll be against those who support death for cartoonists and apostates. Better medicate them all out of it then. Problem solved Including the religion of Atheism? It is not, studying real Islam reveals a very twisted and sad religion That's a very dangerous assertion &amp; diminishes mental instability/illness. You wouldn't say that to be religious is to be....oh, bipolar, would you? No,it doesnt. It highlights what deranged beliefs can do if left unaddressed is the simple answer, stop teaching religion? So u think that Taliban, devout religious Imams etc R all right in the head? you talk to god,you're religions. God talks to you, you're psychotic. -House if you call them mad or sick you relive them of their responsibility pretty fucking simple. You can deny all you want though. p.s. There's a wide rage of mental illnesses. Not just bipolar. I don't have access to their psychiatric records, so I can't make that call. And neither can you. Which is the point being made. Yes, I know, I have one of them (MDD). But I mean...*shrugs* it's not about, it's about ru actively condemning IS, bcos if ur not. Ur one of them. I absolutely can. Killing 1000s for virgins &amp; heaven = Mental Illness. But only atheists claim it proves the inherent evil of Xtianity Whereas atheists seem to be in agreement w Xtians on the ""inherent evil"" of Islam... Basically you've just stated everyone who thinks differently than you is deranged. sounds a pretty islamic thought to me that. So you agree that New Atheism shares absolutism with religion? yes. Believe what you want. Just let others do the same and don't kill them for it but I've yet to see an atheist kill someone for their beliefs Guess your history books didn't include the Communist revolutions then. Oh Communism ... Yuck!Fair point. I agree. But also don't tell them they are deranged, delusional, or moronic. only after they've killed someone ok? Fair enough ha ha! Communist infiltrated RT: oh communism...yuck! Fair point. Silly. Tell your fellow New Atheists that, many missed the memo. when they get to the New Atheist place of worship I will who do they worship as non believers? Harris, Dawkins, Hitchens....evo-psych. no. They agree with them. Without question. How is that different? you don't agree with god you worship him, that's how. I don't think you understand how it works very well :/ really... Look, instead of just dismissing faith as delusion, trying learning about what it means from sources other than its critics. faith is faith. Religion is a whole other thing, and it's religion that kills not faith Ur confusing ""racist"" with ""bigoted"" and changing definitions to meet your needs. oh and I have learnt from more than just critics. My brother in law of 21 years is Muslim, I have 1st hand experience of Islam Well enjoy your sloganeering and your day. I've had enough here. sloganeering! But still true. Have a good day No its people that kill. And they do so because they have both faith (= delusion) plus hate. I think it's because of their own insecurities of their belief. But I agree with you too. is faith really delusion or just faith about a deity delusion? Can you guys untag me from this discussion please? no confusion on my part. Bigotry &amp; racism are synonyms. Post modernist bullshit. No, they're not. The definitions are almost entirely different. that's just, like, your opinion, man and Merriam-Webster's.. but never mind that now LOL,",0

POTUS can spew ANYTHING..and a certain % of people will believe &amp; repeat! same morons that think 9-11 was an inside job complete with hologram airplanes and Boston bombing was a set up Yeah. I would like to know that one too.Radicsl is radical,period.And evil is evil. Truth!:) Way above my pay grade because it looks like they are the same to me. ;) Radical that is...TYPOS. :-D First of all no one is saying it is Isis, secondly there are 1.57 Muslims, only a handful belong to terror groups That is like saying Catholics are all like IRA, or all Buddhist like the Monks killing Muslims. Want to bet it was? If Muslims don't annihilate radicals they are complicit. Evil is evil and it exists in every religion, in every nation. It is people who kill not a religion of ideology How on quote, to Pathological Liar? Well put.There are laws of all lands. People ""should"" follow them and not hate one another because of differences. It isn't Islam if you close your eyes, plug your ears,   and stick your head in the sand. Or if you're Obama. what surprises, me is at this point 6 years in, people act surprised when he blatantly, badly, lies. Ignore everything he says. So many sheeple. scream loudly about everything he does. Did Christian annihilate IRA? Are Buddhists wiping out the Monks killing Muslims. Don‚Äôt stir hatred, you r not helping STAND AGAINST ISIS, SHOW ME! Exactly. They tried rebrand it to ""DAESH"" or some stupid word bc it doesn't include the word  ""Islam"". Problem solved.

Bye Tea Party are independent thinkers, NOT SHEEP! LOL, keep thinking that honey, you lot are the most closed minded people I have ever come across. Sad I'd say the same is Islam.

Try and look at the world with a some intellect I have had better than you my friend. How silly you are. That in itself show who and what you are I'm done wasting my time with this fool,.  BLOCKED LOL Because Muslims attack in the Name of Religion Matter of time. If it were here it would be workplace violence by three lone (?) wolves. That'd make sense, right? SOME MUSLIMS. As do some Christians. Have you forgotten Northern Ireland? 9-11 official story is suspicious. Not saying inside job, just dont believe it fully.

Never trust the gov, period. that I understand , just want to hear how they are complicit read comments w &amp; hv followed her 6yrs-she's a sharp tongue Irianian Muslim who'll never convert 2 christianity! I think I missed all the fun this morning. Looks like you handled it CN :) She's blocked! :) Yep figured that! Life's too short! Make a difference--my New Year's Resolution! God idea to block that idiot!  Islam instructs followers to murder, Christianity instructs people to love! You need to raed more about both Islam and Christianity the study of what the Khoran teaches vs the New Testament clearly shows the reason Islam subjugates!

The @NewYorker cartoonist's response to the #CharlieHebdo attack: http://t.co/uxDrVwl4M3," I think it was made in 2012, Daniel. But what a picture.. It's heavy handed but poignant nevertheless. Sorry I should have clarified. Just found it relevant enough for today's event. no, it's facile of course it is. So powerful. (and in fact it was published in 2006 Giving the Muslim terrorists exactly what they want. What an embarrassment to journalism! It's satirical though. Thank God Islam is the religion of peace, or they'd have killed two dozen. Be careful your ignorance and superficial views are showing. Coddle a religion that allows men to marry 12 year old girls, and cut the heads off those who object? Jihadists don't represent every Muslim. &amp; to be so glib about the quantity of people murdered. agreed Laura. Let's not fall into the typical Western neo-liberal/right wing trap here. Glib? It's an atrocity and thank God the cartoonist hadn't upset the methodists... I see you retweeted something about anti-bullying, yet you are defending a religion that allows a man to punish his wife? Okay, that made me laugh. If Islam is a religion of peace, why would its practitioners live in fear of their fellow followers? There are many passages in the King James Bible that pretty much say the same thing. I defend no religion, but the people Yes, that argument is often used. We ""used"" to allow slavery too, but the enlightened have moved on to the New Testament now Just so you know, I'm not religious. I'm just tolerant of all religions as long as THEY are tolerant as well. No organized religion was or is entirely peaceful. Remember the inquisition? You know the majority of the Muslim population regularly condemn these brutal actions? Tolerance will not educate or make change. Quick naive judgments need more than just tolerance. Condemn? My God, tens of thousands of fellow Muslims can no longer condemn anything as their throats are cut! Condemn with what? Rhetoric? Then they are in good company. Rhetoric is in heavy supply in your camp. Yes, quick naive judgements like all police are racists. There is more than enough naivet√© to go around. All religions are not equal. Religions that oppress based on sex, belief, sexual orientation etc cannot be supported. Period. Again the problem with your argument is that it's a blanket statement you can apply to any religion/ideology which remains true. ""if christianity is religion of peace, etc"". for sake of argument let's presume any ideology can be hijacked. fundamentalism often has nothing to do with religion but with authoritarianism. In this case it's the problem of a perception of cultural intrusion, fighting own temptation to integrate. Daniel, the ""fundamentals"" of Islam already place ""Man"" in a position of authoritarianism over woman. Christianity has accepted that woman is a partner. In spite of the Old Testament, Christianity does preach love. Except against Homosexuals right? Wrong. I know of no western religious leader that promotes the persecution of gays. Isis tosses them to death! What about the subject of gay union in the eyes of God? Look, this isn't the point. Yea there might be varying degrees of interpretation of freedom, which is always relative to socio-economic context, etc but when we talk about terrorists THIS good/evil argument is the problem and avoids the fundamental questions No death by burning, true, but they make it clear gays are not welcome... which don't really have to do with religion. If you want to have that debate, that's separate and NOT for you but the Muslim community to debate over. The ""Fundamental"" question is, will Islamic leaders ever recognize the human rights of those who dissent? No it's not. Not in this argument. Because that's not what spawned ISIS and various fundamentalist groups. Laura, again, I know of no sane Christian religious leader who preaches hate against gays. No one is excluded... The whole ""marriage"" vs ""union"" debate is silly. However, journalists will allow the bashing of Christianity... even embrace it, but they run in fear of bashing Islam...almost religiously! Journalists are a fucking joke. Recommended reading. ""hijacking of Islam by the Taliban"" Malala is a wonder. The UN pays lip service to her courage and cause. Also, for the record, even ""moderate"" Islamic leaders for the most part, ""hate"" the existence of Israel. No one ""Hijacked"" Islam. Islam made it possible to justify horrible acts in its name... there's an argument for pro-western liberal anti Islam-bashing yes but its inverse also equally deterrable If the Catholics started murdering, journalists would immediately point to the Old Testament and say the bible.. taught the hate! This quick read is gateway into right perspective towards issue i'll leave it at that Guys, enjoyed it. I gotta cook supper for my wife or she'll beat me. Best to you.  Dan",0
The response to #CharlieHebdo should be to reprint his work and spread it wider than his killers could have thought possible," I bet too many media outlets are afraid for themselves to do this. thanks I will start by retweeting this Louise, or are you really a muslim apologist? That's what said, Louise, and has attracted a very strange set of respondents. Reprint and we will re killUntil you respect our prophet , like you respect the zionism or jews Fair play to finger-on-the-pulse for her support for Monsieur Hebdo. oh lord. And give all satrists Uzi License. Boy oh boy does know how to spread the hate. &amp; loves to do it too, by begging for more hate cartoons Beggars Belief! I do not fear you or your murderous brothers. I know true Muslims and they do not kill for free speech agree, every newspaper etc should have their work on the front page tomorrow! We did not kill for free speechHe is prophet mohamed you do know that CHARLIEHEBDO is not a he but a its! It's a publication not a person! JESUISCHARLIE The people who did this were not true Muslims. his?? There's surely?? Mind you I only went to Bedales so what do I know? &gt;&gt;&gt; Its people like you who bring dishonour to the Prophet (pbuh) and Islam. You should be ashamed of yourself that is your belief not mine. Is Allah (SWT) weak? Does he desire these deaths? Is He not compassionate and merciful? Fuck you I've reprinted. What are you going to do? I condemn this act bt making fun of other religions by cartoons is wrong.They made pic of prophet(P.B.U.H). it is rude, it is offensive and unpleasant. It is also free speech to offend us religious folk Can you talk about the crimes of the Jews in Palestine ? But Ironically talking about the Prophet mohamed is free speech I don't believe you are a Muslim. Why to do sport the Rabia sign when they have nothing to do with terrorism let's be clear here - death for insulting Islam/Mohammed is enshrined in Quran and Hadiths. It IS true Islam, sadly. ‚Äú: Reprint and we will re killUntil you respect our prophet‚Äù Grow up you backward Pillock. Its 2015 not 1015. You tell em Louise U rape someone and then ask them nt to slap u Shame on you. (rhetorical efficiency is me) Nothing says ""worship me"" like the threat of death. just tell this imbecile that jews been characterised by others all the time but they don't slaughter If only they'd READ the Quran instead of killing people in its name. Even Ikwan web whose rabia symbol uses condemned this. He's just SCUM Lool Not knowing the facts doesn't bother Ms Mensch I am talking about how they thinkingIs it hard to Pass a law to prevent exposure to the religions ? so can't you take a little bit of humour with your bile? ‚Äú: We did not kill for free speechHe is prophet mohamed"" is the Prophet Mohammed?WOW spring she says that people should re print their work, and a oerson points out its racially aggravating to islam and then she agrees with the fact its racist, but then goes onto say being racist is right becuase people have free speech. Weird lady like I said, responds without knowing the facts. Lots of knee jerking methinks You can't legislate people what not to say, it's called freedom of speech. I accept different views, I don't want to kill them. Rape is a cartoon, killing is 'a slap'. Mental JESUISCHARLIE Depends which bit they read. you seem very insecure about your religion. If you're sure you're right, why care what anyone says? That's why I said read Quran. True if they were morons &amp; de-contextualised with a cut &amp; paste. Then they had other issues yes they were. No true Scotsman fallacy. you are comparing rape and murder to drawing a picture. Really? Disgraceful. Problem is there are morons who do just that to justify running about with AK47s. A drawing is not rape, a slap is not a kill. Your prophet (pbuh) can survive a cartoon, he is a strong man not a wimp I know believe me I do not equate him and Muslims or Islam Nor should anyone, we really need to think about a redefinition of our notion of offence, Christian Jew or Muslim, all sons of Abraham, Religion may be humour 4 u bt nt 4 us!let me clear that!!We respect ur religion respects ours in turn It was an example!Donot describe others religion by making cartoons!!We respect ur religion u respect ours Yes, and I touch on illegitimate barrier some have created in my blog here&gt;&gt; Then what sbout the killing of more than 5000 innocent people killed in american drone attacks The thing is its in our religion nt to picture any prophet!!Muslims have told the world about it a million times bt u tease us Thats what happened in 2010 i guess when a movie was made about Prophets and whole muslim world reacted to that too!! It was just an exampleEverybody knows that it is nt allowed in our religion 2 picture a prophet bt u tease muslims a ridiculous example and in very poor taste. ""Teasing"" does not warrant murder. Agree? I CONDEMN THIS ATTACK!!And yea its teasing !we all now muslims react strongly when it comes to religion. yeah its like provoking somebody to take a hard step!!U knw muslim world is against this thing so stop doing it which only serves to show their insecurities over their own faith. never. They need to grow up. Its like u guys have made it a profession!!I guess 5 years back a movie was made and muslim world strongly reacted there were wrong then and they are wrong now. The problem is theirs, not their critics. They need to grow a pair. Its not insecurity its they follow it really strongly and love it more than anything!RELIGION IS LIKE LIFE 4 US in which case you have internalised an idea, so you have moved beyond reason. This is your problem,not theirs. Lets just end this in this way RESPECT MY RELIGION I WILL RESPECT URS AND I AGAIN CONDEMN THIS Believe me if u say something wrong to my PROPHET I would nt bash ur religion cuz thats what my PROPHET(PBUH) told us I respect your right to believe whatever you want. I am in no way obliged to respect the belief itself. you'd struggle to bash my religion. This world would finish in a sec if u dnt care bout our prblms and we care bout urs!I GUESS THATS WHAT HUMAN BEINGS DO FOR PEACE and I wouldn't kill you if you did. I would never even do it!!cuz i respect ur belief!THAT IS WHAT MY RELIGION TOLD ME AND I GUESS MOST MUSLIMS HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT people mocking your belief is not a problem unless you choose to make it one. Neither would i kill u if bash my religion This is d basic thing Muslims love their religion more than themselves.when u disrespect their religion these things will happen which makes those that do so disgusting and lacking in actual faith. Blasphemy laws imply that an all-powerful god is incapable of defending itself.This clearly makes blasphemy laws blasphemous Anyways it was a nice debate!AT THE END""RESPECT MY RELIGION I WILL RESPECT URS"" I agree whn u make fun of anyones belief again nd again then they do such thingsnd when such a stage comes they cant see clearly which is their problem to resolve, not the critics. Time people grew a backbone. What is ur belief???i mean r u an atheist,christian or what???? I respect all religions. I also can see satire for what it is. THEN IT WILL BECOME A WILDEST DREAM TO BRING PEACE IN THE WORLD we have relatively peace here in the UK, where every idea is open to critique. How do you explain that? atheist. Cuz GOD is supreme he doesnt need to defend himself its us who need to defend themselves cuz we r flawed not over cartoons you don't. Just deal with it. Like I said, grow up. I'm a son of Brenda and Phil. What does that have to do with some French journalists? Have I fathered Benjamin Button or something ? What is my religion exactly? I don't ask you to respect any of my crazy unfounded beliefs no, we will never stop doing satire against any subject. NEVER, and your kind will never stop us. be kind, she's a good sort I think, just misled. I know, but I am really starting to worry about what world my son will grow up in. I can relate. But we are at our best when we stick to our best ideals. Cheesy I know. But true. Evidently needs to do some research, CHARLIEHEBDO is a magazine, not a person u kill b/c your prophet, let me say that again a prophet of ur fucked up religion, holy fuck thats fucked up Charlie Hebdo was very critical of Jews and Israel Muhammad Life of the Prophet: Spiritual and contemporary teachings",0

Right before I handed you over to the victim's families. Who said they were Islamic? They haven't been identified yet. I was responding to re: 'Islamic prophet' but I'd also add that when ppl kill for such nonsense we KNOW their religion. No one knows WHY they killed those poor folks. Jumping to conclusions and supporting them can be dangerous. They yelled it from the top of their lungs... That their prophet had been 'avenged'. What part do you not understand? Anyone can shout that,&amp; i watched the video too,they also shouted Alluhu Akbar.Doesn't MEAN they were Islamic/Muslim. Then what do those specific statements mean to you?

May well be Islamic extremists but until there's evidence.....??? Occam's Razor. Stop being a chickenshit. Know what's even more dangerous? Blind and ignorant faith to ancient myths... Religion! Also dangerous is jumping to conclusions with minimal evidence, as i said before. You deserve coffee. All well trained &amp; professional. Israel did just declare war on France re Gaza.

"I deleted my suggestion that Paris attacks be blamed on US drones, when it became apparent that even that EXTREME sarcasm was being missed."," Why are you retweeting the BNP? hitler was an atheist without a sarcasm font, it is not advisable to try dry comedy on twitter, or online at all, really. SARCASMFONT For some, stupidity knows no bounds. Poe's Law. Sorry about that, I wouldn't have blamed you for it, but I would have been unable to laugh. That bad for us here... For once I agree with you. You must have people among your followers that wilfully misunderstand everything you say... Sorry to say ive already had the 'apologists' out in force. You are sort of right. With or without sarcasm! Hitler was very Christian .... The problem with obvious sarcasm is that people are willfully stupid. You remind us that even brilliant people have blind spots of stupidity. It's like you are doing a test on the rest of us. Actually, he was an Athiest As an American, it often seems as if others routinely blame us for their problems. If not drones then ketchup or reality TV. No, he was not. now you're really getting twitter :P ""Satire an invitation to Islamic terror?"" Is like 'Attire an invitation to rape?"" Some tv channels in India claiming former! Hitler opposed organised religion. But he did believe in God. Hitler invented the Athiest Religion actually he was Christian ..... why would an atheist kill Jews? You have to admit, reality TV is worse than anything ever inflicted upon the world Actually, *adjusts fedora* He was Athiest what evidence do u have supporting this, JD? Obviously. Indeed, there are two reality programs currently airing that deal with the problem of reality TV Hitler was Christian this is fact .... little known fact, Hitler was also an MRA ;-) Deliver us from reality TV he was Christian .... Born and raised.... lol,He was Christian, find some other arrangement ... that was a false statement made up to decorate him from Christianity... a meme? U have a meme as supporting evidence? Seriously Graphic Evidence Piggie .... in response to another meme, yes Hey Didn't .... you can deny it all you like he was Christian... indeed he did Hitler was Atheist Christian ....there is plenty of historical evidence to prove it... You can deny all you like he was Athiest We Agree to Disagree .... I researched the atheist quote. Can't find a reference for that other than the meme. I don't believe it's factual Hello, native German speaker here, those buckles read ""God isn't real"". Common mistranslation why would an atheist give a shit about the Jews? Look at muslim extremist. He was a christian &amp; an extremist. what's this... hahaha! (I know you were joking which is why I'm laughing, not because a common talking point is disarmed) I learned something today.*the more you know* actually your German sucks....is says good it's with us... while we're at it. Let's break this down. Atheist don't believe in a god period. Even if he wasn't christian... he thought he was a god according to this meme. Therefore it does not support the theory. Yes Hitler was an Atheist it doesn't support he was atheist either... why you gotta be so rude? while we are at? Have I responded to you yet? You are what we call in my culture a ""√ºstorlengm√∂lsch"" - it means a very silly, deluded little man it's not rude look it up ..... He wasn't atheist ..... He wasn't a good Christian but he had Christian beliefs look away all you want Atheists, you can't deny the facts that's fine but your wrong... Pictures don Lie I don't believe you won this one. Have a nice day Hitler was using Catholicism as a smokescreen to do genocide in the name of ATHEISM a bunch of Athiest? What's your point? Being in denial does not mean you .... he was using Catholicism to create the matter race.... I barely engaged either of you two and you flooded my mentions I won Its true.. This was all outlined in Mein Kampf (Which literally means My Unbelief) won what? The quiet game? What's a matter race? no pivotal evidence ... It's   photographic evidence .... Master Race Pardon Me ... Oh yeah, the master race of ATHEISTS ya, agreed. JD is all about creating a matter-taddee I just baited all you think about it LOL .... IF IT HELPS YOU SLEEP BETTER ... No Hitler stated that his ""conduct is in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator"" It doesn't. HITLER killing millions for ATHEISM is sick, bub üòÇüòÇ fucking idiot. Just admit you couldn't find evidence supporting ur statement killing millions is wrong .... But we differ on his motivation ... historians agree that hitler lost the war because of his atheism you clearly don't get it Yes, he was referring to himself This can only be settled with dueling Downfall videos. Go! Yes, we Germans refer 2 it as a ""m√ºllerk√∂rnerkleft"",meaning only athiests wd disagree Mein Kampf ... Translates to ""My Struggle"" ..... Yes, a lot of ATHEISTS struggle to come to terms that HITLER killed for ATHEISM that's false information .... He did not... Yeah that is why his troops had ""God With Us"" (""Gott Mit Uns"") on their belt buckles... Consider this tho: He did and thus photo is a fake.... He did not ... Have you considered that maybe he did not? wrong have you considered and researched the ideals of a mass murder are his own... That's cool. There's no sin for lying in ATHEISM so you are permitted to lie Hitler was Christian, now stfu with your bullshit. LMAO Wikipedia Which quotes his speeches and writings.There is no more legit source.But please, quote Fox news. you cited a meme. You have zero room to laugh i don't think you should be talking about a sense of humor Or maybe the people who can't see the sarcasm are just unimaginably stupid? Obviously. What other reason could there be? Saint Ding Dong ( ) is infallible. why won't atheists just accept hitler was one of them? embrace it yes any good Athiest knows he belongs to the religion of Hitler ha ha aha ...at least spell it right : ATHEIST Hitler was Athiets nothing says atheist like I'm not clicking that it's a tryably a neo nama page Why are you calling Professor Dawkins St. Ding Dong? I don't understand? St. Wanker? Does that work better for you? Why are you being so disrespectful? Professor Dawkins is a leading figure in the natural sciences. Or maybe the people who can't see the sarcasm are just unimaginably stupid? It was easy to see that Professor Dawkins was being sarcastic. You - not so much. I wasn't being sarcastic, I think the man is a pretentious wiener. A) Is that so hard to fathom, B ) Why do you care? Why tweet something if you don't care what people think? If you don't care, don't tweet. You come across as being sad and angry. Wrong. Hitler was a Roman Catholic. The Nazis had Gott mitt uns etched into their belt buckles Common misconception. Hitler was definitely Athiest ATHIETS, again what do you mean by that word??? Hitler had not Tits??? (right spelling is ATHEIST) Hitler= an Athiest are you freaking robot?? is Athiest some kind of inner word?? just an educator, Hitler was an Athiest, now you know en educator with Dyslexia ????? do you see the difference between ATHEIST and ATHIEST??? hint, you are swapping E and I an educator* you switched your ""e"" and ""a"" dud , looks like you have dyslexia . You just copy my educator and pasted into yours. I guess you are a lost cause, bye learn to spell NOP , that one is fake.

Keep it to itself if that's what u chose- don't chose for everyone. its murder plain and simple! why is it that when someone does something with an Islamic name its been addressed as muslim why? and look who's killing innocent and hundreds of children why don't we condemn and judge them individually? you kill people when you don't like what they say??? pliz spare me the joke of freedom of speechÿå prophet Muhammad is so dear to us for someone to abuse him. thats murder &amp; hiding behind religion doesn't justify it! U don't have to like it, but they have the right 2 speach everyday people say and do things we don't like- you walk around killing people!! Islam is peace whether you like it or not BT some Muslims are trying to destroy it no need for abuse put facts on table it depends who there referring to Rip! you don't kill people who don't share your beliefs.

Stand out publicly You are enjoying your freedom of speach. How does it feel to not get killed for it.

I am sure you dont have to worry about it since your fighting a war on twitter..are you an American? and my point is none of those people tortured anyone! not by murdering them.

We're not backward like you munter. lol, he was ugly with a hairy mole on his shoulder. Cross-eyed, buck toothed, spotty &amp; bags under eyes I just noticed you wear makeup! Good for you. Must be hard being Trans and a muslim. I'm actually finding this funnyYour hilarious thanks 4 all the laughs I know. I love muslim trans men they're so funny. looooooool how do you know??? Looool stop describing yourself he had to be ugly - otherwise he wouldn't've had to marry a child-whore, a slave and an old hag. and if he did? I'd send him to you. You obv like cock. All muslim men are obsessed with cock. these things are not a problem to intelligent parents. Only imbeciles have problems with gender and sex The point is we have a right to offend Good idea. Let's do. Let's not b cowed down. How m a NY will they kill? Muslims want to create a fear psychosis Muslims say ""BEWARE.TOUCH ALLAH/MOHD. N SEE WHAT WE DO""It has to end.Stand up. I don't see how drawing someone's prophet in a shitty way mends any society right now. Who's responsible for ""mending"" murderers minds? Where is personal responsibility? You've missed the ""heart"" of this. Free speech is worth dying for, even if Muslim killers are against it oh no I get it. Believe me. Freedom of speech is sacred, but if we're ""calling for unity"", this won't work. I'm not interested in men mending anything. I'm interested in protecting free speech Unity w whom? The ppl who kill blasphemers? Um, no I guess. I dunno. I'm just really sad and angry-cartoons aren't soothing my atheist heart. I am speaking for myself: I don't desire ""unity"" w/Muslims that want to kill me or force me to live THEIR way unity within humanity, my friend. We've all gotta live on this planet when the blood...or ink...dries. oh me neither. But are we trying to rise above or stoop here? Coexistence is only possible if everyone learns to tolerate blasphemy Can we have both? I think we are all sad and angry... Except those that support what happened today. Goes beyond ""cartoons"" I think this answers that Actually, even if you converted, they'd kill you anyway. TCOT MUSLIMS I feel you. Truly. Listen I hate all religion. ""My religion is Charlie Hebdo"" :) Every religion is blasphemy to at least one other one. Not to mention atheism which annoys everyone (joking) ha thanks for not killing me for annoying you. BRINGBACKJIHADISTJOE Islam itself is blasphemy against Christianity, and Christianity is blasphemy against Judaism. &amp; that's okay Trust me, Muslims are not ""calling for unity"" with anyone that is not of Islam. Crap, there goes my plans... Lol There will not be unity on this planet when those exist who don't allow others to live/practice their beliefs I love you for fucking it up LOL That's not true. Good Muslims are. This man is lying I think these people are amazing...thanks for a good tweet thread. Keep the flame burning. wtf? It's a matter of opinion I suppose. When most accommodate but one constantly threatens your way of life... living my life the way I wish according to my beliefs is not ""stooping"" imo. I don't threaten others to submit I know all this. Trust me. Just trying to figure out how to feel about all this. My anger is deep and raging. Tune into my blog tonight. I'll be talking about it and the domestic terrorist I've been dealing w I'll make a point of it. Because you, sir/madam, are on point tonight. sir and meant lol.Ignorance Muslims force Christian to accept Islam then behead him fuckers. Talk about welching on the deal!

"Am so shocked.Charlie Hebdo's editors,journalists,cartoonists are killed by Islamic terrorists.Time to declare Islam as terrorists' religion"," Was the Hiroshma and Nagashika devastated by World War II was also Muslim? WE ARE NOT FUCKING TERRORISTS !!!!!!! In every religion there is some terrorist, you can't blame a religion for those some bad people. See the movie MYNAMEISKHAN time to declare you as a 'Bitch' as well what about that? That is why you will never come to Bangladesh.Atheist No religion preach terrorism only few people does terrorists have no religion. They are basically fanatics having very little or zero idea about what they are fighting for. Time to declare as Worst Bitch of India.  shame on you. terrorists in every religion pls stop with the same islamaphobic &amp; racist rhetoric that still gets Muslims abused/killed why? Please explain. Should that happen, all 'Super Secular' political parties in India would be cleaned out. this is bit too much. Agreed Truth is always too much not really. Shows level of disgust the believers have reached. unless xtreme uncomfort sets in,reforms won't surface if few intolerant ppl can brand Hindus as RW extremists, -JEHADI brigade=terrorist's Islam. Analogy Maybe not, but you are believing fucking terrorists' religion. HAHAHAHA wow Cz you're a specialist in Islam ? Cz you know everything about it right ? then whats difference btw them and us ? i agree here. Major voices have to come from within. Madam u r emphatically wrong. If anybody follow religion truthfully, it is terrorists. why wasting ur time with this bastard üëâüëâ U don't get to be mad at anyone on a day like 2day.12 people are dead, be mad at that. Taslim has freedom of speech Well I'm free to defend my religion , freedom of speech right? amaal, don't waste your time on people like this , not worth it, not even a second of your life :-) don't even try discussing with that filthy minded despicable filth. She knows nothing abt Islam or our prophets! Yes ignore the victims. Their deaths means nothing. Get a heart.

"Horrible tragedy in Paris today was not done by Muslims, but done by terrorists. Let us unite against hate + pray for peace. #CharlieHebdo"," CHARLIEHEBDO: This Attack Was Nothing To Do With Free Speech‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIt Was About War lier ... Muslims and Islam are one in the sane! Hate all of it! Evil pure evil you mean Muslim terrorists.  The attackers identified themselves as Muslims, who are you question how they identify themselves? - They pretended that they do evil acts in the name Prophet Mohammed (PBUH). They're nothing  but terrorists, ciminals and thugs. you might not like how they identified themselves but who are you to say they are. It ""real"" Muslims Ahh, they must be Buddhist terrorists! terrorists have really used the Islamic religion to carry out inhuman acts it's about time everyone stands up against them You're all done your little coploving crying jag now? white supremacists  terrorists consider themselves ""good Christians"" BULLSHIT!! They were Muslim terrorist! Did Obama tell you to say that? CHARLIEHEBDO -  I heard, I think on CNN, one of the terrorists said, ""they have retaliated for Prophet Mohammed."" Not my word. so as soon as it‚Äôs negative news we ignore the religion and close our eyes, seriously? I appreciete the positive spirit but‚Ä¶. White supremacists terrorists call themselves ""christians"" I guess you can say Christians and Christianity is evil their are people who kill innocent people in Palestine and steal their land &amp; call themselves Jews. get a Qur'an and read it . It condemns what these crazies are doing. Jesus didn't tell white Christians to blow up churches what I'm trying to say: (this guy is way more eloquent than I.) Muslim terrorists. The latter doesn't negate the former. we Need to stand up against the white supremacists ""Christian"" terrorists in USA as well just like the white supremacists terrorists in USA call themselves ""Christians"" Nope! i call them evil! What the fuck are you smoking? When have u seen gunners leaving the a multi-murder scene yelling Jesus is great? - Oh! I wasn't disagreeing with that. My point is that they're not true MUSLIMS When evil is committed by people who call themselves Jews &amp; Christians. Should we condemn the entire faith? - That's exactly my point. I said they pretended that they have retaliated on behalf of Prophet Mohammed (PBUH). they call themselves Christians. So do I condemn the faith of Christianity because of what terrorists do in the name of jesus what have u been smoking? They blow up churches and light crosses in people's yard. You living in the past. It's 2015 , not 1960. LOL MENTALMIDGETS the point is to acknowledge that parts of the Islamic faith can be interpreted in a barbaric way.Doesn't HAVE to - Indeed, Charlie! For me, they are MUSLIMS with a satanic, criminal, terrorist mind. A church was recently burned down in ferguson by Christian terrorists. those are in Myanmar Are you sure those idiots mad about that thug getting shot didn't burn it? They burned a bunch of shit you know. whatever dude! we do that with Christian terrorists all the time maybe those so-called Muslims terrorist are CIA operatives. We can go on and on wih this. and they must have done the Paris terrorist attack. Right? Probably Black Supremacist! They burned the Seven Eleven too! GOOD , now your mask is coming off. terrorists using Islam to justify heinous acts are not Muslim, they are terrorists. and why are the terrorists in Myanmar Buddhist,  hypocrite and coward? you are a Coptic Christian? This is the reality of true Muslims Do you know what Islamists do to Lesbians &amp; gays? in some nations,do you know what heinous acts are carried everyday by various people claiming affinity to every religion? Answer: Do you know what's the penalty for lesbians and gays in Islam? do you know what the Biblical penalty is? They are the same. do you know the Prophet Abraham? He is the prophet of Judism, Christianity, and Islam Do you know who kills lesbians and gays now? Ahhh, The Blah, Blah, Blah! many people still even in the US oh, mad because your God is also the God of Judism and Islam? You really love to bed Islamic terrorists.  That is odd for a normal lesbian,  isn't it? I'm not a lesbian, but thanks for the assumption Anyway,  enjoy bedding your Islamic terrorists. calling me whore-classy have a good night. You are a hyopocrite calling the terrorists in Maynmar Buddhist terrorists and refusing to call the Paris terrorists Muslim. I only sent that so you could see the absurdity of both Ah, Yeah, If You If You SO SO. because you are biased and refuse to truly see this for what it is. 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, if they were truly violent there would be a much bigger problem than extemist attacks Oh, the blah, blah, blah of the idiots! white people burn churches not blacks. The pastor of the church was active in organizing the protest. the hardest most criminal minded blacks would not burn down a place of worship. That's what white racist do. You are an Evil human being A 'Race Baiter' would burn it! You might want to question Rev. Al? I'm committed to fighting white racist christian terrorists in good ole USA | mark your bingo cards I feel the same about you fake want to be Jews. The synagogue of Satan Why just ""white""?? And why just ""Christian""?? That seems a little racist. the kkk, neo-Nazis &amp; others call themselves good Christians but, want and are trying to exterminate blacks. blacks kill more blacks than anyone else! You should be anti-black! whites kill more whites. My point  is there is terrorists in USA targeting blacks the media don't give a Damn no justice. when whites are targeted but someone who calls themselves Muslim then all Muslims are terrorists. The media is very powerful. My battle is not in UK its in the U.S. you should research before you pick a fight with 80% of the population kkk and neo Nazis are Christian terrorists groups in the U.S. whould it be fair for me to label Christianity an evil religion? so 80% of the population are members of the kkk and Nazis? White But they still get the privilege pass. Sound the whistle paradox.",0
"The cartoons are here, amongst other places - http://t.co/eVkPpzpJf1 #JeSuisCharlie"," that we will not be threatened by terrorism. Abhor many of them but obviously abhor murder far, far more Huge respect to the for printing them - we need every news company to do the same. Oooh. I'm sure those 11 people who are dead appreciate it. Just meaningless platitudes that make you feel better. may I suggest it's time to repost your comments on taking offence? They seem very apt. considering they are the ones who drew the pictures, you are right. They do appreciate it. I'm sure their grieving friends and families are comforted. POINTLESS given one the police officers murdered was a muslim, should cartoons that could offend his family be reposted? And you acting like a holier than thou douchebag is helping so much? Get real. STFU. you're kidding, right? These guys lived to make  comics - continuing their work is what they would want. Really intelligent comeback there. Well done üëè - it shows how feeble some folks are. Getting offended over a cartoon and then killing for it.  that is insane! 'comics'?? Really? They intentionally set out to cause offence and the French govt explicitly advised them biggest insult to their memory would be to concede to fear as the terrorists want. Spread the pix to honor them on numerous occasions not to do it. None of which condones in the slightest what the terrorists did tho doesn't show dead people anything. Shows terrorists that they won't silence ideas. Shows solidarity w/ survivors. I totally agree. so you're saying it's okay that terrorists killed 12 people because they disagreed with free speech? But in the process, continuing to offend Muslims. I agree with this view Its your choice to take offence. Make better choices. It's your choice to take offence. Make better choices. And continues to offend mainstream Muslims. It was and is 'stupid' absolutely agree. Saying ""I disagree with your point"" is okay - massacre is not. if you read the second part of my tweet, you'll see I in no way condone that and it's horrific. It sounds like you are happy they were shut up. People who kill over a cartoon are the problem, not the cartoon. so what. No one has the right to be protected from being offended. Charlie Hebdo also satirised Jews &amp; Christians but you are saying we roll over and allow the terrorists the freedom to kill, as free expression should be repressed, no? Agreed and no sane person would say otherwise but that's the point, the terrorists aren't the answer is more speech. Speak out, speak out against terrorists who hijack your religion. but you're still missing the fact that if we hide the posts, the terrorists win. it 'sounds' like I'm happy?? What planet are you on. You sound like George Bush 'with us or against them' offend them more. Offend Christians, atheists, Jews, Asians. Makes no difference.Who cares that they're offended? you can't say a religion is a religion of peace and love and then threaten to kill those who insult it. That question is offensive bro. Did they have a special edition satirising Christians and Jews? They intentionally targeted Islam to get publicity You keep blaming the victim, maybe you want to look into that first. no. Everyone should and has free speech but most people use that responsibly. I have the right to shout Fire but don't do so what if I'm offended that women are allowed to speak out of turn? Yes.Next question, or are you just going to keep being an ignorant apologist? on a crowded train or theatre. What did they gain by doing this when no other publications did? take 5 minutes to google Charlie covers. Their take on the Christian trinity and homophobia is pretty harsh. you're missing the point of satire. It's supposed to be borderline comedy. Those who take it otherwise need thicker skins. You mean like all the major Muslim nations have? they set out to make a point. They did. Win what? And what do we gain? their covers lampooning Catholic Church hypocrisy, the inability to criticise jewish extremism, etc... what do we gain other than offending mainstream people? Fuck you islam, fuck you christian, fuck you invisible friend illness spreader. they want to instill fear.To dictate our lives. Silencing free speech is surrender by saying something no one else would. They spoke out and continued through oppression. And now the world looks on agreeing I do think they were incredibly stupid but again, nothing justifies terrorism. Nothing. Feel free to be offended and I defend your right to feel such way and speak out about it. That they were ""stupid"" is irrelevant and an insult to them. Maybe they were just braver than you. and I am glad and hopeful Arab and Muslim leaders are speaking out. It is a turning point. I want to support moderates. apologist for what? Just because I disagree with the cartoons makes me an  apologist for terrorists? don't the cartoonists have the right to speak out about religions then? Not sure ending up dead and being firebombed is worth the laughs but that's a decision every person makes themselves. Which is? not a rhetorical question. I care about freedom of speech &amp; the policeman's family, so the issue troubles me. why should there be another objective? Offense can be their objective and still be valid. Again, intelligent comeback.Well Done. disagree with the cartoons. But what can you expect when you criticise people for refusing to be silenced? they published hundreds of comics. I'm sure you're savvy enough to extrapolate some meaning from a few. ""Fuck you, oppression"". people should be free to repost the offending cartoons, but is this a reasonable thing to do? And what were they saying other than causing offence, intentionally? Death is the extreme. But these cartoonists stood for what they believed in the face of adversity. That's admirable. 'Braver'. One mans bravery is another mans stupidity. Idolising them now they're dead is easy to do. Awww. Are you offended? Are you !slam? You must be. I have two words, can u figure them out It's SATIRE. Would you have this much angst against The Onion? They had messages to say, and they told them. And I reserve the right to be offended and to speak up. Why is that difficult to understand? Not advocating violence tho And here, in a quiet corner of Twitter, is the problem entirely. Help me because I fail to understand it. tough tatties if people take offence, it's satire. That's the point. No need to look if it's annoying the whole world is offended by what happened the offensive part was death. Are firebombs and bullets are a worthy response to satire? Are you actually implying people should be silent? Oh give me a break. Just mindless platitudes that are used in the papers and news to make them look like heroes. Total tripe you are saying we should censor the images or at least their spread, because it is offensive. That is the issue Why is it difficult for you to understand that I don't have to agree with everything the Lord says? Move on. you do know us lot in Europe have been brought up with the ideal of free speech? Its our right! What's the problem with disagreeing with someones point of view and why are you so offended by that? You should be more offended by those who use your religion to firebomb and kill. I'm not saying agree with Stephen Fry, at all. I'm saying realise that you're apologising for terrorists. Agreed. I take offence but I'm not about to commit murder. People disagree, it's a democracy. Move on. a few points I can see -religions are hypocritical. Politicians (at least some) are corrupt. Etc. multiple.duh? No &amp; no. You can disagree, be offended and not advocate violence. A distinction that some on Twitter find difficult I will defend your right to belief what you want. I will stand against those who want to impose their beliefs on others. Again, do not see what is gained in the slightest from this at all. Why have many publications not published them? I was born &amp; bred in the UK so when you say 'us lot in Europe', I'm one of you. Stop being offensive. no one is forcing them to publish anything. You are either trolling or quite illogical in this it seems. well get on the same page then. And why can't I be both? It's not a zero sum game. Again, you can be against both although I place murder much higher up the list than publishing some stupid, thoughtless cartoons. Oh dear god. So thinking the cartoons are stupid is apologising for terrorists? There goes any logical argument. 1. Then go out there and teach your young men what is a worthy response. Teach them that firebombs... No problem at all with that. they were not thoughtless. You don't get it. Never will. 2. ... And bullets are not the answer. Go to your mosques and root out the ones preaching violence. Not trolling mate. I think you can be for free speech, against terrorism and still not republish the cartoons. Simple. Why should I?? So because I disagree with your point of view, I'm not 'one of you'?? We live in a democracy!! If you are go out there and do something about it. Start reaching out to those angry young men. then you're just wrong. Oh dear god. 'Teach your young ones' sorry but there are 1.6 billions Muslims in the world, what % do you think are terrorists. You make it sound like most young Muslims are terrorists which is what some in the media peddle. And that's your point of view. I disagree. End of civil conversation. Funny u say the ""with us or against us"" line. I know a religion that says the same. 'Kill infidels' 1. A very tiny one. But one which has had a huge impact on ppls lives. I do not support the issues which... 2... Make extremists kill, yet people like me are affected by the attacks. You have the responsibility... Read the Old Testament lately? btw what's yours? Don't piss of religion of peace, they might kill you? Anything less gives in to islamist insanity. few nutters is stupid and illogical. Move one. We can't be cowards. They are drawings FFS. right. Respect freedom of speech but also choose to respect the policeman's family (and other law abiding muslims). looking to the day 99% of muslims treat scripture same way 99% Christians &amp; Jews treat theirs. absolutely. A heinous crime and expression of ideas must be protected. Being respectful is a choice. Exactly my point. Muslims are the greatest victims of their own silly religion. given contrast between the muslim terrorist &amp; muslim policeman, I'm avoiding sweeping generalisations. yes, religious books are crap including OT. Real problem is all follwers think there's not a word wrong in Q book The day ppl r ready to admit portions of these books could be wrong &amp; outdated, the world would be a lot better you fucking imbecile. To talk of 'offence' in the face of murder. There speaks the voice of moderate Islam. another intelligent response.  Glad you exercise your right of free speech. Blocked. then you missed the point of FREESPEECH if your claim a god exists like Thor, Ra or allah without offering proof Defend your right by using guns and killing people. Grow up. Satire is healthy in society Terrorists follow an ideology rather than having a mental illness. They use religion to control. They are fascists. We need humour That sounds like a threat. How do so? Uh...ok. Guess that says it all right there. because I accuse them of being stupid, means I'm threatening them? You must have a really thin skin Basically u are saying if u continue to offend Muslims u r stupid &amp; deserve any repercussions. Erm, no. That's what YOU just said. Why continually assume I mean one thing when I said the opposite? whatever, back track all you want, you still come off as a terrorist sympathizer &amp; apologist. aaaaaand we finally get there. Took your time. All boils down to that in the end. was literally the point myself and others were making to be fair...",0
British press publish horrifying photos of police officer being murdered - but not Charlie Hebdo cartoons. Strange values. #JeSuisCharlie," same in Australia. Craven and shameful. I see nothing wrong with it. It is the reality which is hidden and not felt. Press that doesn't publish the cartoons are COWARDS Not strange values, just cowardice. Unlike France, religious nut jobs have already achieved their aim in the UK. Britain is full of sniveling cowards these days. It is disgraceful. British Values: Greed Based System of Inherited Privilege enforced by state violence and inbred complicit courts. did any British newspaper publish the cartoons ? in india at least one newspaper has shown the courage Because they're scared shitless of the PC backlash. Remember, the government panders to the minority. Craven but 'protection of staff' argument works. Noone wants that responsibility. Thus we are all tyrannised by this ideology. my naive guess lots of terrorism/terrorists funding media If you were a friend or relative of the murdered police officer, you might feel differently. somebody could be offended... they are moral cowards, pure and simple. I wouldn't! Thanks for the reply. The UK is firmly under the jackboot of political correctness. media should be clear whether self-censorship is so as not to 'offend' perceived religious sensibilities or to protect staff. I take protection of staff seriously, though many would accept risk. No risk showing man being shot dead but painful for family. Agree. No, publishing the cartoons serves the terrorists' goal of inciting hatred of Muslims, which will only bring them more recruits. Or, as has been shown in the past, a harsh reaction against Muslims will create more sympathy and recruits for the extremists. 1/ There have already been several attacks against mosques in France today. That only serves the agenda of the terrorists. No, inciting more anger against Muslims only serves the interests of the terrorists, who use it to drum up recruits and support. but ANYTHING incites their violence, the very fact YOU are not a Muslim is enough reason for them to be violent, so unless... you are a total pacifist and are willing to alter every aspect of your life and freedom to appease Muslims, you must fight... the ideology at every turn, its like saying we must accept racism otherwise racist will be violent, it's a cowards reasoning. No, that's silly and juvenile rhetoric. The vast majority of Muslim violence is in direct response to occupation or aggression 1/ apart from what is done explicitly to create an atmosphere of anger that will only elicit more sympathy for their cause. You have no idea what I am, but I can you're phenomenally uninformed when it comes to terrorism and Islam, just like Dr. Dawkins. It's absolutely nothing like that whatsoever. You need to listen instead of just waiting to try to poke holes in the issue. You're doing exactly what Cheney and Bush and the others did when they made the worst decision the US has made in a century. I have not time to debate with apologists for jihad, the ""if only we were nice to them they would stop killing us"" rhetoric... No, of course not. You've only got time for unthinking bigotry and hatred. has been debunked countless times. more Muslims are killed by other Muslims than by anyone else, so that renders your argument... No, it's not been debunked, you're just mindlessly suckling at the fetid and swollen teat of ignorant Islamophobia. that its the west fault and all our own doing completely void. stop making excuses for their 6th century violent psychopathy. you know you've lost the debate when you start rattling off ""bigotry"" and ""islamophobia"" You lost the debate when you signed on as a sycophant to someone who knows absolutely nothing about Islam or terrorism. all you need to do to know about Islam and Terrorism is be alive in this world, Islam will do the rest for you. Actually Muslims only account for 10% of world's terrorist attacks. Secularists are the majority. Get an education on this topic. not a man fond of providing proof are you? yet you have the nerve to tell me to educate myself. Cavanaugh, The Myth of Religious Violence; Paper, Cutting the Fuse; Kruglanski, The Psychology of Terrorism . . . Crenshaw, Explaining Suicide Terrorism; I can point to dozens of other books and articles after you've read those texts. *Pape, not Paper. Silly autocorrect. books on these subjects are usually biased, I prefer viewing debates between intellectuals, which is where I base my opinion. So you base it on rhetoric instead of on scholarship. I see. Why not read the scholarship instead of just assume? that would be quite an indictment vs Islam if that was all it took...and they just capitulate? Not at all. Group solidarity is the salient factor, and it works the same way with secular ideologies and their terrorists. not rhetoric, intellectuals debating in a public forum who are then fact checked after debates. as opposed to your pro jihad books Debates are about rhetoric, not facts. Nobody attends a fact-checking session, and just dismissing scholarship because it 1/",0
So now let's talk seriously about #CharlieHebdo and Western double standard on freedom of speech http://t.co/X8iyp64azl," Hey, at least the ADL doesn't riddle you with bullets for making anti-Israeli cartoons. Defending pro-Israel lobby? Shit, man... not true. CHARIEHEBDO lampooned Judaism and Christianity as well. JESUISCHARLIE Sorry to disappoint you, Jane Not nearly as much as it lampooned Islam. Islam first &amp; foremost, Catholcism second, Orthodox Judaism third That's the impression I've formed from seeing multiple Charlie cartoons. Oh, is it going to be like that? See, you like to draw pictures to make a point; I like to sketch *arguments* to make mine. I wonder if that reflects the efforts of various extremist groups to repress free speech? I suspect such... 1/2 efforts primarily came from the extremists in Islam. 2/2 Charlie Hebdo did make fun about every religions! You should know BETTER ! Unless when dealing with the good old ""anti-Semtism"" You surely don't know Charlie Hebdo... Or you have to buy some good glasses. Buy a pair for yourself and read this article, moron ""Well done"" for the RT.From yesterday's tragedy did you understand this?Suppose you are ready to light bakeries I am a political ""thumbs up"" for the RT.From yesterday's tragedy you understood? Suppose you are ready to light up ovens Good shit but we are talking about deaths of people.Continue as you think you seem to be implying that they don't make fun of everyone If you look at the cartoon better it says something completely different from ovens.Have I seen a mistake? I think you really saw it wrong.Or you or I.I don't insist, let each of us think about I did.And? Please don't pretend you're interested in civilised interaction &amp; then support tweets abusing me knowing it will show up ... He talks about the double weights in the West with which I totally agree.I don't see anything else. in my notifications. That, IMO, is the height of rudeness. (keep your insults with your lack of intelligence, please!) that, IMHO, is free speech. We have a choice on here: respectful interaction or abuse/ridicule. They are mutually exclusive. The ""West"" is not expressed single.We are the west, do you see ourselves expressing identical? I have never abused or ridiculed you. If I liked a turn of phrase in another tweet and favourite it, that's my preogative. If.. you wish to use that as an excuse not to engage with me, that's YOUR prerogative. Let's go again.I can make a mistake.I realized that you are -& gt for the West SME measures when you sketch Jews? -& gt;Filonzi while when sketching Muslims you are covered by freedom of speech.Does it show anything else?And you talked to me about- & gt? ovens.Anti -Sun i'm from my genuses I am open to interaction but in order for interaction to be meaningful and fruitful a certain amount of mutual respect ... is required. That is all I ask. you're repeating yourself now. Engage with me or don't, but don't hide behind indignation because I liked another tweet. to agree on some indeed.The ""West"" and the Western media are not expressed unified and militant.Work freely & gt; & gt; and from different positions.Fortunately.Even in Israel the government, its actions, and even & gt; & gt; And the irrational intervention of religion in the state.I disagree about the category you attribute to western media It came moments after perfectly respectful interaction, so the juxtaposition was discomforting. I have no idea why you felt the need to tweet that to all your followers rather than simply reply to me. We can freely satirize Yahweh and no one will kill us.But Allah? Not that religion is to blame.The fanatical bumps are leaving, not Islam I have the deep suspicion and almost certainty that western media do not work freely but it is a big issue to exhaust in a satirical Akau.Let's say the majority of the Greek type serves interests Religion is not.But religious leaders are bastards as you said yourself, my conversation with you was perfectly respectful. Why are you so upset that I liked someone's tweet? AGREE. because Twitter is a large, inclusive, worldwide conversation and I like to get other points of view. I'd welcome others... to join this discussion, wouldn't you? B/c I had to deal w/ nasty tweets last night (many of which were from ppl with whom I've never interacted). I am more than ... willing to discuss w/ ppl who don't share my views (if only some liberals were so willing). I prefer those discussions ... to be mutually respectful &amp; non-insulting. Favouriting that tweet seemed like an insult. If they can rein in the childish name-calling, labelling and general unpleasantness. If I wanted to insult you,, I would do it directly, not by favouriting a tweet. This is getting frankly ridiculous. Are you... willing to get back to a discussion of free speech, or not? Again, there was no need to tweet that to everyone. I don't agree with name-calling/personal insults. However I will pull no punches in terms of beliefs/ideology. Ideas=fair game. Fighting the nun again? I have to leave that discussion for now. I'm sure I'll return to it later. I hope for mature, civilised discussion. oh for crying out loud. This=ridiculous.Do you hope that criticising my Twitter behaviour I'll forget to discuss free speech? if you can act maturely, then bring it. All you've done this morning is plead insult where none exists. The discussion was about free speech. Let's stick to that. I didn't follow up well-mannered interaction by favouriting a tweet calling you awful. Have I been awful to you? I don't ... believe I have. I take ppl as I find them. I would prefer if you held off on thinking me awful until I tweet something ... you ask for maturity then behave like a child. I thought you didn't have time for a discussion on free speech? that gives you cause to do so. I disagree with just about everything I've ever seen you tweet. However, I believe in free speech and have never insulted you. so I've had plenty of 'just cause' as you put it, but I won't belittle myself by insulting you personally. Now, free speech? I'll don't have time to fully flesh out my position now. My basic point would be that one can defend freedom of speech ... w/o celebrating speech that is problematic. Many Charlie cartoons fail into that category, IMO. define problematic? If speech was only free if it said non-problematic things the world would never change.what'd be the point? How quickly the easily offended are to jump to defend a mag whose raison d'√™tre was offensiveness What is offensive ? Caricatures and humor ? Seriously ? Caricatures are quite often meant to disturb or offend - see '30s Nazi propaganda posters etc. Also I'm not sure a discussion of humour is helpful. I don't find the CH brand at all funny. I don't think you really know Charlie hebdo neither the cartoonists that died. But it's ok. Possibly. And you cld be talking shite, but that's ok.Twitter's all abt freedom to offend, right? Absolutely. See, I am responding to you and reading you... and to lie, and hatemonger, it seems - quite often. Oh constantly.",0
The hypocrisy in the western world‚Ä¶ (Political cartoon from Carlos Latuff) #CharlieHebdo http://t.co/EkMKJTfIyk," If Muslims have the decency to respect Jesus, then that same respect should be returned to Prophet Muhammad (SAW). Look at ur own backyard,evry single forum is filled with hate for Jews..hw many killed till date?? Mockery should not be made about anyone or anything. What if something dear to you was Mocked? (1) So your blaming the entire 1.8 billion Muslims for what's occurring in Isreali/Palestine? (2) It's Palestinians who are being mercilessly sputtered day in/day out Are you trying to justify these terrible killings? I cant believe this. There was reason for murder (3) Before Israeli, Jews and Muslims lived peacefully in many parts of the world Read the article.. u will no threis no peace with muslims (except a few)  if there is no blood in sight. There are 1.8 billion Muslims, if only a ""few"" were peaceful I doubt this world would be the same. muslims call Jews and Christians by names I dont wana repeat cause its too disgusting,so touch your own nose before accusing oth of anything...and just as a side note the ones in the PARISATTACK were not jews they were islamic terrorists!! Could already tell you're a bigot, rather not waste time. Btw that was used as an example to show double standards. honey the thing is that they made fun of every religion and the only violent response came from Islam!!!! No. If you Iooked at my recent post you'd see what that photo was referring to. I am not a jew nor is anyone in my family but its just really unnecessary to drag jews into this issue in any way! they have nothing to do with this issue!!! üò© hopeless...bye I grew up in Europe and I know that all the religions there are treated equally! Like in Said Hopeless ... Bye !! The world is terror ridden &amp; even a wiki list of world terrorist organizations will tell you is behind the terror. Read There is no evidence this is so. It is an assumption fostered by media. Unless it is shown that this is another Israeli false flag perpetrated by notorious terrorist Mossad sorry, but I cant take you and what you say serious...just not logic! Please, don't ever let history &amp; facts interfere with your fantasies the only one fantasizing here is youuu...üòÇ OK I am willing to agree that you are not very bright Charlie Hebdo fired one of his own employees, a satirist Sine for an anti-Semitic cartoon. the satirists themselves know how mediocre n insensitive their cartoons are. They do it just to satisfy their hate. So killing them is okay? seriously? that's all you hv as a comeback on the article? I never said killing them is OK. My TL says opposite do even realize what you are typing here? Im not even waisting my time with you....bye i guess that can be said abt you since you're bringing in irrelevant things like ""do you even realise..."" perfect. when you don't have legitimate counter replies on facts that ridicule your point just chicken out. everything you just said is irrelevant... You don't even realize the amount of hate you are spreading you definitely  need help, but you wont get any hereüòÇ last time I checked I'm not the one being so blatantly hypocritical having double standards yea right. throw personal attack on the person when you don't have anything factual and 'on the point' to say the only one here with double standards is you, and what facts have you presented?..all I see is a man spreading hate by this here. throwing in those smileys work all the fuckin time like a charm when you're speechless right? üòÇ speechless?? Go read a book....üòÇüòÇüòÇ you don't even want to read that article because that will make you think about your hypocrisy. Ignorance is bliss. you are pathetic dont start something you cant end! By the way are you following me? Awkwardüòë exactly. And I'm quite enjoying exploring how Internet trolls these days are so hollow in their counter replies go read a book and please one about humanity and one about critical thinking she's gone. facts and rational discussions repel bigots. READ WHAT?? THERE IS NOTHINGTHERE There is a link to an article my lord..!! how many himdus rss killings muslims dumb bastard Count me one u pea brain..!! unless there is a riot in which Hindus also get killed...",0
Let¬¥s get serious about #CharlieHebdo and West's double standards on freedom of speech! http://t.co/g5wR4TnstL," Aha, I see...some issues are protected by freedom of speech, others not...hmmm...double standard at best! I don't think that's a like-to-like comparison but agree with the sentiment of hypocrisy. One is poking fun at religious zealots and the other at the death of millions. The big difference needs explaining to you? Sure, double standard, some issues are protected by freedom of speech, others arent no, you can publish a cartoon of the holocaust if you want, but it's abhorrent... a cartoon of Mohammed is no big deal... :) but there are restrictions on freedom of speech, eg. hate speech :) The line always has to be drawn somewhere but that doesn't necessarily imply double standards - just a limit. you know, holocaust is not a religion or fictional character. Ah well, nevermind. That's a huge difference of subject. Cartoons of one fake person or cartoons of a massacre killing millions of people for their race&amp;religion is no equal to mockking a prophet. I see, one issue deserve freedom of speech the other don't...double standard yeah! Well, if we are talking about freedom of speech, there are no red lines, we can mock EVERYTHING ""Well done"" for the RT.From yesterday's tragedy did you understand this?Suppose you are ready to light bakeries acc to human rights law, actually there are red lines of freedom of expression: defamation, threat, hate speech. criticizing religion is no hate speech. preventive tweet :) Freedom of speech, the real one, has no red lines, sorry erdem there could be legal consequences regarding your point, and one can risk it in the name of freedom+ Live and Let Live. says a cartoonist. and I respect that but I will stick to ECHR verdicts. TY. that is how freedoms are earned (remember world is not flat! argument) yet it is still freedom Well!This is mentioned in the sketch, well the jokes for Mohammed, but they are anti -Semitic with the Jews. OK that is accepted but at the end of the day to compare making fun of Holocoust &amp; Mohammed won't be justified + by the consciences of people IMHO. We all joke, freely.Did you see Jews killing someone because it was saturated with them?All in the mixer? ... to mocking a prophet, an idea. there's a story when u point at others u have 4 fingers pointing back at u check hand Did you understand this again from the sketch?Okay... Anyway Israelis kill with much more innocent occasions You're unfair here Where to see Christians.It is not a matter of religion, but fanaticism. So why are you reacting to him? why;When did the Jews killed someone because he sat down to Yahweh? Why such times, this found to be exploited to take out the beliefs of are hours of sadness and meditation, not cheap anti -Semitism Where did you see him anti -Semitism? this is exactly! I saw this. Human rights abuse, and not just freedom of speech, is the daily life for & GT? Mistake you saw I don't know, I think the Palestinians have a little bit of a language .. I guess I have that right. & lt; Arab population in Israel.Will you tell me, dissimilar situations?Not at all.I will not analyze more & gt? & lt; why is there really no reason, but the double standards in freedom of speech and our sensitivities & gt? & lt; they are absolutely real and let's not pretend. Because we confuse everything.One is a war of two countries, the other is a war on the right to free thinking No, dear, it's not a war of two countries.I talked to you, deliberately, about the Arab minority in Israel And of course the right to free thinking and expression is only part of the war they receive there I guess, however, you will agree that it is paradoxical, again to talk about Jews. The discussion was me, I just commented on it :) My pleasure to all participate in such discussions.Freely and fine And mine. no it's not. There is no prohibition of depictions of Jesus in Christianity. Your right, I agree that your free to publish. That I think one is more tasteless than the other is an opinion. Yes it does. You clearly know nothing about ethics. Or the law. Or anything, going by your tweets. If you notice the Holocaust (6m dead) not Jews or yhv. dont agree. One should be able to make jokes about holocaust. I think that is repulsive, sick unnecessary, not funny and distastefull but still. Free speech above all as long as you dont ask for another holocaust/violence. You'd be on to something if sometime later today group of armed Jews raided this cartoonist's house &amp; shot him. In countries with free speech, we don't kill you for either one. Holocaust cartoons are protected expression in the US. HTH. No, no and no...one is a fictitious ""god"", the other is the torture &amp; death of millions, try thinking. a cartoon mocking holocaust/Jews in general will get you fired &amp; possibly jail tho.üòíbut not mocking muslims Doesn't...mocking a minority group which is already oppressed in that society is easy &amp; acceptable that mag mocked the girls captured by Boko haram. Making them look like savages to make a joke would same mag ever use holocaust to make a joke... NO üòíüòí that magazine mocked those innocent girls taken by Biko haram to make a joke about welfare .. which is imo absolutely allowed. And though sick it maybe also draws attention to it. Didnt see the cartoon though do u think they would ever use a holocaust joke to make a point "" draw attention"" ?? depends for what. But thats not my point anyway. I dont say i like/enjoy these pics. Just that it is and 1/2 should be allowed. As long as it doesnt call for violence. do u have a link to the mentioned cartoon? at end of day CHARLIEHEBDO shouldn't be praised &amp; looked at as a beacon for free speech... when their free speech is so selective... how do you think Muslims are 'oppressed' in the west...? :) I'm not sure if u kno any Muslims but ask any one of them.Living in the west is great n I'm thankful but its not easy... yes, idiots on public transport etc can be abusive... but it's not classified as 'oppression'... u could call it discrimination the "" discrimination"" goes way beyond public transport that's why I call it oppression esp when mainstream media (fox) ... is targeting everyday Muslims by saying they are no different than the terrorists who kill.. Fox news say a lot of stupid things... :) have you ever considered giving your life to Jesus...? :) well they have a huge ass audience, n when u add bill Mahar's audience.. that's pretty much all of America hating Muslims thus justifying any attack on Muslims moderate or not all the muslims I have met, and there aren't very many, have all been friendly... it's the ones on tv that are not very nice :) unfortunately many have only heard of the ones on TV I love jesus (PBUH) as much as any other prophet in Islam Jesus died for everyone, if you put your faith in him, he will forgive your sins... :) the right to free speach is not an obligation to think/speak about everything not funny indeed. Not at all.  But dont see a problem why not to publish apart from commercial reasons. No, only if you are black &amp; wearing a hoodie. Or just black. ICANTBREATHE WESTERNPRIVILEGE I can write sagas I dont have the time no country is perfect ! according to 'western' values! But western values  twist and turn but the facts remain the same=Sham! says WHO! cmon, it's a bit of a silly rule... :)",0
"Paris Terrorist was Radicalized by Bush‚Äôs Iraq War, Abu Ghraib Torture http://t.co/0Gz5nKVpQP http://t.co/AwgpcRWca7"," If those silly wars didn't happen they would have found something else to blame. lame excuse ' and as such, an excellent patsy. They really know who to frame. where'd they get their weapons? They had those since bush war? I know but I want to see if you know. Nonsense. Name a single islamic terrorist without a legitimate and stated political grievance. Here we go again. It's all the fault of the US. The West has it coming... yada, yada. CHARLIEHEBDO this is the world on liberalism, moron. where are you talking about? What is legitimate in your opinion? the evil that men do has long reaching consequences!  Evil spawns more evil! NEVER FORGET genocidal invasions occupations of Terror r War CRIMES! Never Forget France UK USA and Nato attack dogs have killed countless innocent people in Iraq Libya Afghan Syria these politicians covered blood sir if u apply your scientific mind properly u can even link all the Muslim Invaders of the yore to Bush's Iraq war. (Contd) Agree on US prompt. But structure of radicalization traces to a system of Islamic belief, marginal perhaps, but concrete. I think the fact that Baghdad endured a 7-year occupation and humiliation isn't really on most westerners' minds. Null empathy. this discovery will make u bigger intellectual mind than Einstein. Even the discovery of DNA can not beat d discovery that (contd) Vietnam war radicalized me, but I didn't shoot pro-war people. Weathermen did, and it was abhorrent, nihilist, counterproductive what about targeting property rather than people? line blurred? Here is a good example.  Only asking you for a single name. What r u waiting for? Ghenghis khan or the invaders who invaded india n other parts, or indulged in cruelty did so because of the Bush's iraq war Why do you think I call it silly?  if those wars didn't ocure there would have been other griefance silly implies trivial, Those persons commiting these crimes where born and raised in France, where they learned. about Iraq. Truth is that they (extremist) always find reasons to do what they want to do. ISIS There was too much indiscriminate violence, &amp; it hurt anti war cause. Compare with vets' ""re-enactments"" What are you talking about? Please explain and be a little relaxt if you can! Please name a SINGLE Islamic terrorist who was not at least partially motivated by a legitimate political grievance. Thank you. Damned if we do, damned if we don't. I am done. D-O-N-E with this B.S. Whats the problem, i don't disagree with you except that y state ""legimate"" isnt at all. They don't help people they kill helping the KURDS to fight IS is legimate cause. not butchering innoc.people with other beliefs like YEZIDI CHRISTIANS Do you agreew those idiots? With so called legimate causes? while their swine leaders steal and rob their idiots kill rape? I used to be an apologist for Islam.  Not anymore.  Islam is evil. bad comes in all colors but right here? Crackers taking the lead lol don't know what u mean, so asking Wat do u mean? this picture of crackers is self explanatory this is why the world fucked up because you don't know what the fuck I mean lol then cut the obscenities &amp; say clearly what u mean! white people are savages what due ""crackers"" mean? I do not understand african/American slang? white people faggots look what they doing to these people white o i c , crackers means white ppl? they making people of color do acts they don't normally participate in humiliating them not all white ppl , nor all black ppl, nor all ppl r savage, yup whip crackers this pic is proof otherwise your race has existed because of it's abhorrent treatment of people of color whites only race using nuclear bombs tho where the others doing this? where the niggas inventing bigger guns? my friend, despite the suffering endured, we must not FALL 2 their level!

I haven killed anyone I'm furious whites won't comprehend their role in this I understand your anger! The Strong Wrestle anger to the ground. &amp; emerge stronger! I'm cool breh but yo not everyone is so understanding hence collateral damage the arrogant criminals never do!

The Earth without Art is just 'Eh'. #streetart #JeSuisCharlie http://t.co/72XpFM2kOn," Your name is all over Twitter. It feels like it. I actually saw your status saying JESUISCHARLIE before the news and wondered why you're saying you're Charlie in French... You Said it. love this Rightly said! All the art lovers out there would surely agree with it. BEINTERESTING STREETART so pay for art as you would expect to pay for food. Artists need to eat too. So i do?! So many people pirate nowdays, and call it ""sharing"". yes they do that's why u shouldn't put shit up that u don't want to share But if you put it in a box and don't let anyone see it ever, you never sell anything. A shop puts it's products in a window, as advertising, not as an invitation to steal. If someone breaks the glass to get it, that person is a thief, not a customer. yes that's why u have stuff u put on the net to be over exposed and collections u display n sell? I like Julian's work, if I were to print one of his pieces, frame and hang it, I break the glass. what if the person takes a photo of it and posts it it's not the same as actually stealing the object Jessica, It must be sheer heaven being married to you. (sarcasm) It is steeling intellectual property you apologistic cow, &amp; a violation of copyright law. yes that's why self respecting art respecting people won't do it but that's the chance u take putting shit online a photo has it's own copyright, immaterial of the subject.JUSTSAYING LOL lmao what's that supposed to mean WOA NOW I'M A Cow!Why mooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo no need for the hate if u don't want ur shit stolen copy right it print ur logo across it At least you acknowledge that you are a cow. Everything is signed, dated and marked copyright. That is all that I need, to sue a thief. are you short or something is this why your picking on me mooooooooooo do u acknowledge that u have a small penis and are a angry lil man Worst case of Mad Cow Disease I've ever seen. ok great there you go sue away why am I being targeted by u in this rant moooooooooooooooo hold up lemme steal some of your art ok bye why are you so angry Wowser. You can omit me from further shouting at the interwebs please. ;) who are you ppl I didn't steal any of yo dam ugly art ppl don't buy of ya'll coz of ur attitude My apologies, She was blocked and reported the moment she threatened to steal my work. I suggest other artists do the same. That may be if an artwork is included, incidentally, in a photo, however unauthorized reproduction is a federal offense. By incidentally, I mean, by example, if it is hanging on a wall behind someone taking a selfie. If said photo were isolated from context of the selfie, and reproduced, per se, that would be --- --- a violation of copyright law. All this is codified in detail. You may need to protect your own work someday. I hope not Ah you are talking US copyright law. I know about UK copyright law - and law is seemingly quite different then. Still, International treaty obligations demand that US law, and British law, be mutually respected. And again, I apologize for any distress that I may have inadvertently caused you. On the other hand, description of the method Jack the ripper used to subdue his victims, is considered property of the ... Times of London. This is something we yanks consider very odd. To us, news is public domain, but we still have to respect British copyright law. Canaletto's paintings are consicered by US law to be old enough for public domain, however, if I were to reproduce Canaletto from King George's collection, I would have to obtain permission from Her Royal Majesty, Queen Elizabeth,and attach a notification, to the image stating that I had done so.",0
Those turning on Muslims after yesterday‚Äôs vile atrocity are doing exactly what terrorists want them to do. Me: http://t.co/rTJ2A1Ck8Y," I don't condone murder but also hate disrespect shown to religion by cartoons take heart that most have done the opposite IAMAHMED Merabet, French Police Officer murdered protecting Extremist Satirists from Extremist Muslims. shouldn't just be muslims though eh..‚ÄúThose who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.‚Äù - Voltaire the headline is pretty dodgy.  Why would Norway have given in to islamaphobia after a white dude killed a bunch of people? Muslim fundamentalists and extreme-right activists are objective allies. Always have been. We must not give in to hatred. a white non muslim... So, Owen, what's YOUR solution to this then? What does the world DO to STOP this happening again? Solutions,please - not words! Problem is that the people too ignorant to realise this just see 'Muslim' attacker &amp; attack Muslims back. Breivik wasn't Muslim not words? What do you want - a diagram? Solutions and answers are needed. Not words. You know what I mean! I don't usually RT but solidarity! Some of the criticism in comments is spectacularly vile. Oh wen! &amp; THEGUARDIAN is full of suckholes like u who love muslims &amp; find every softcock excuse for them being in GB So are you going to hate your peaceful Muslim work mate for the actions of a few very angry people? : precisely, they want to drive a wedge between Muslims and non-Muslims. We must never allow that to happen The West has ""interfered"" in Middle East and poked a huge nest of wasps. Probably deliberately as part of agenda to divide/rule Welcome to UK 2014! Stupidity is rife. says the descendant of immigrants who, unlike British Muslims, annihilated the indigenous population & lt; --- Douchebag Alert Very Christian statement. I can hear Jesus saying that. ooh, Tony! what language! bit of a weak religion that can't take satire. Loosen up. There is no such thing as an extremist satirist. Haha you, sir, are an idiot. Some of us have hardcock excuses for supporting Muslims, love. C'est la vie! Wow! Christian? I'm not sure Jesus would have been proud of Tony. you can't beat a bit of Queensland red neck tolerance Is he ukip?! what a charmer you are And you profess to be a Christian? May God forgive you Not Words?Bizarre. People must differentiate between attacking an ideology (FREEDOM) and attacking those who follow it Why does a man who lives in Australia care about Muslims being in the UK? DOUCHEOFTHEDAY You don't even live in GB, sporty. Satire of raped, pregnant, kidnapped Muslim girls begging for benefits is extreme... Can U ? No1 virtue for any Christian is to tell the truth. But u Brits don't know what is true anymore You do realise that other religions are capable of such atrocities as well. Israel and the IRA for eg Actions speak louder than words. That is my point! Too much talking a good game and not enough playing! Clearer now? satire takes many forms. But it can't be 'extreme'. Oh sorry! Forgot u dumbarse Brits are fragile to the realities of the world, but u idiots 'l accept muslims! Amazing. And depiction of a black politician as a monkey ? Twitter is 140 characters so I substituted ""Extremist"" for ""Racist Inflammatory Incitement to Religious Hatred"" I do know he is an idiot. Could just be a troll.Ignore the trolls. Stop Being Anti-Semantic Love your enemies. Pray for those who hurt you. (Compare and contrast) I can only guess that yours must b very hard Keep rooting for ur peace living muzzies LOL!! I don't think u could be sure of anything, let alone of what Jesus thinks LOL! Virtue do you know the meaning of the word . C'mon surely u can do better than that!!! Thanks, but couldn't come close to the charm &amp; hospitality u Brits offer the soon to be masters of ur destiny. Viva Le Muslim Like Jesus I don't resile from telling TRUTH Maybe u sd look crap doctrines of unequivocal accept LOOKESABITKIP P.s. Quick heads up: Your view on no. 1 Christian virtue differs from Jesus'. (love God/neighbour) Maybe because I have more knowledge, understanding &amp; appreciation of ur history than you do stop going into silly wars all across the middle east So? Maybe I care enough 2give the ppl of what was once a gr8 nation a tap on shoulder &amp; say WAKE UP - ur losing GB Are you Tony Gibson or Christopher Marlowe? "" Oh so this psychopathic murderous lot is all the West's fault!OkayThat figures - not!MH + brain washed perhaps? I think it's attitudes and views such as yours are a slight on your countrymen, grow up mate! Do u realise that Islam is the ONLY religion which exorts its followers 2violence. Xtians r 4bidden are you confusing satire with insult? If we just ignore the terrorists, they'll probably go away. in my understanding  I'm no scholar‚Ä¶may I ask how many leading Islamic scholars have you spoken 2 And don't cast pearls before swine lest they tear u to pieces i myself am a practicing muslim..went to a catholic school..have friends of different faith Have you ever read the Quran? It also forbids violence, extremists interpret it differently. seem to get along quite well..we have difference of opnions but get along well regardless The Church of England has lost the virtues of Wisdom &amp; Prudence in Rowan Williams Mad as a brush. (lesser known apocryphal gospel) Forgiveness is No 1 Christian virtue.But then idiots like you and the French killers twist religion But seriously, do you think Jesus was wrong to say love your enemies? Tommy u r a true detective. The former but blocked on ninemsn so had 2 b creative That's quite a claim when you know next to nothing about me! Do you get much grief as an immigrant? As drawing can spark reaction, writing can prevent action on irrational generalisations: words=action I speak what I know is true. It's gr8 2welcome strangers, but know more abt them before being uncondit very convoluted way of saying you don't believe the pen is mightier than the sword. Oh just thought it odd given your views you choose identity of a homosexual atheist That's ok.There was a time when I thought it reasonable 2 conclude he wrote 4 Shakespe Well put. JESUISCHARLIE NOTINMYNAME Its got some legs as a theory still can't get my head around what I can only think ... of as your very extremist Christian viewpoint Beg to differ. U guys r lost atm because u don't know how to discern truth from falsehood U know that according 2ur faith u cannot have friends o/side of ur religion. Y not keep ur friends and ditch islam? It only creates division &amp; hatred towards non-believers Rubbish! The qur'an is not set out chronologically, but from longer 2 shorter verses. The later verses take precedence to the earlier &amp; are notably belligerent &amp; uncompromising to non-muslims Rowan Williams was a good leader Tony are you a follower of Christ . Rowan Williams was the most ignorant Primate of the Church of England since ThomCramner Islam is my identity ..if it wasn't for that i wouldn't be tolerant of you‚Ä¶ ;P It's prob ur identity from birth- if so then maybe more familial connection than pure islamic? Islam demands that u see Mohammad as the template 4how u conduct ur life. He was an unsavory charac u are beginning to sound like the extremists you profess to despise. Careful steps Tony the IRA was a political group. i practice my faith by studying with scholars and sufi masters‚Ä¶do you practice your faith.. ‚Ä¶with similar guidance from your priests.etc I do my best, but in the end it's about being honest &amp; truthful. I see Mohammad as an impediment Thanks Course not, that's your job? You didn't answer my question. Was Jesus right to think you should love your enemies? no it does not. Get ur facts right Islam didn't shoot the cartoonists, some idiots did. Don't conflate the group and individuals in it. for me there's always been a wedge ..we are a secular country don't like it f off we don't want your nonsense here . Major Muslim groups all over the world condemned the shootings. In the name of God. You forgot to mention this. They are the facts, &amp; if ur muslim u know I speak the truth You are entitled to your opinion‚Ä¶My Beloved Prophet Peace be Upon Him taught me to love Jesus Peace be Upon Him and to disrespect Jesus for me is a sin Oh my God! Moslem countries were minding their own business until Western corporate interests ""invaded"" &amp; millions died. Yes, he did but he didn't command that u honour &amp; fall in with their ways So, ur Mohammad was Good Man? For me without a doubt‚Ä¶and so are you for respecting me and my beliefs as i respect you and‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ Your Beliefs‚Ä¶ Lets Put in Differenti Aside and Be good Humans :) U know he was a violent man &amp; beheaded 900 men of Banu Qurayza. How can u follow someone like that? i also know an old Jewish woman throwing rubbish at him and he never retaliated‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶i also know that when he returned to Makkah, the people that had killed his friends and family were forgiven.. as for the statement you have stated..what is the chain of narration..give me the arabic.. ‚Ä¶give me the history of this? etc..as i state I'm no scholar but will gladly direct the Q..and he won't have that, he'll have read something somewhere written by someone that found a mis translation ‚Ä¶ Get an ANSWER i know‚Ä¶otherwise the 99.9 percent of the muslims would have agreed with the delusional rest he is like the misguided muslims who research by reading books written by fools instead of questioning scholars..studying the language and spending a life of reading Exactly, both extremists and people who blame the whole religion are indoctrinated by the same means. Here u go  It's acknowledged in the hadith that he did this hahaha‚Ä¶first of all this has been forwarded to a scholar.. ‚Ä¶whom comparing it to the arabic has cleared that the translation is rough..once an accurate So are you telling me that Mohammad categorically DIDN'T do this? i get clear answer will glad to post it..or if you are a sincere christian out for truth..speak This is why ISIS behead- it is in the tradition of what their leader Mohammad did. as i stated..im NOT a scholar..so speak to a scholar and tell me what he says ISIS may also have been mislead by a misinterpretation of the text Please yes the fools read the same thing you do..approx 126 scholars have written to baghdadi proving Not so. It is acknowledged in the hadith that this is what Mohammad did. So now ISIS do it too as Jesus said ""come on to me those that have been security vetted and are similar to me too "" Billy Baker meet Fahad Faker going to the fair, Said Billy to Fahad u look fine &amp; fair to me.Haha thought Fahad... first the bible then this, so many fairy stories Fair enough You have a good day &amp; plz hug a muzzie for me while ur at it muzzle eh? True colours shining through, any other deluded religious group you disapprove of ? They're all mental btw I thought it was to love God and your FELLOW man. true. But he definitely did not use the word softcock. U can't love what u don't know. First acknowledge what is true so u know what ur loving True. I did deviate there Scriptural not .... if we trade insults with those we disagree we do not further our faith we degrade it. U believe in Scripture because u judge it reasonable to do so.A prerequisite 2 faith (Scripture) No. WE DO IT IN FAVARS Does that explain massacres in African and other countries? Bali etc?No!You're barking up the wrong tree! People in the west need wake up , realise its their Satanic govt , looking for any excuse to profit Try telling that to children with pens , killed &amp; deformed by depleated uranium presumably you disapprove of father ted then you utter div? you have little grasp of history or current affairs. Ottoman Empire Span: You don't grasp the meaning then, eh? No , you dont grasp what killing in the name of greed is ...EH? U don't understand that any hope of attrocities stopping is not through violence Correct , so y do the west kill children with chemicals &amp; drones ? yes , thats what i thought . don't get me started on murderous political actions throughout the world. Oh dear , you sound upset rambo , pls dont hurt me too What a bizarre tweet. Rambo? Who calls for the pen rather than the sword? Yikes!2015!Hahahahaha! You are entitled to your opinion, and others to their opinions. Does not make any of us right. what you're stating isn't an opinion, it's a falsehood. Muslim entities have been waging war since day 1. the Moors conquered most of Southern Europe and later the Ottoman Empire. in 1960s, Egypt, Syria and Jordan waged war on Israel. Wikipedia is not a source of fact. Never quote Wiki to back you opinion/argument, it lets you down. in this case it is correct. I know the history you don't. Read. you might learn something. between 16th &amp; 19th Fulani Muslims conquered and enslaved most of central Africa. From my very limited knowledge of Fulani. Did they not originate in N Africa? a number of areas including North African Berbers. They waged Islamic jihad across North and Central Africa conquering&amp;enslaving they were the main supplier of slaves to the Atlantic slave trade. with the Barbary States (Ottoman-Muslim)in the north enslaving around 1.5million Europeans into slavery. Hs been evr thus throughout history all ovr world. Invasion, pillage,rape,slavery,exploitation in name of power/profit/religion They seem to love it when there's a terrorist attack tbh, It feeds the hate. right so your original point about Islamic countries minding their own business is clearly wrong right? :-) It is pointless going back centuries. I was referring to more recent 20th century in Middle East. Civilisations rise &amp; fall. I gave you examples throught the era jordan, Egypt and Syria attacked Israel, Saddam invaded Iran, gassed the Kurds and massacred 500k of his own people. Saddam Attacked Invaded Kuwait. I mean have you ever read the history of Africa and the Middle East? It's one big violent war from beginning to end. then you have the Taliban in afghan, Islamists in North west China, Chechnya. It's the history of the world!! Invasions, wars, land and mineral stealing, genocide. ""Christian""  or Muslim invaders the same. What about ""Christians"" land stealing and genocide of Native Americans.""Christian"" Germans genocide of Jews, Roma? The West armed him! Then West/corporate interests took over.Hand of US in every modern war. War makes money for the powerful. the Russians armed him. 85% of iraq's weapons came from Russia. Satire is aimed at the powerful, not the voiceless. This wasn't satire, just racism JESUISAHMED Are you seriously suggesting organised religion isn't powerful?  Isn't that who it was aimed at? Ordinary Muslims certainly not powerful, v much discriminated against, &amp; suffering from attacks on them Was that an answer to my question?",0
