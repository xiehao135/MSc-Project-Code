"Jews, Catholics, Muslims, white people, black people. Everyone attacked by Charlie Hebdo, yet who reacts like this? http://t.co/fkvhfJxPoO","@MrHarryCole the ones the West has been killing non stop maybe? @GazTheJourno @MrHarryCole Muslims? @Rolo_Tamasi @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno They would react the same even if the west pulled out of every Islamic country. @MrHarryCole @ChandrusWeb Why are some people of this faith so afraid of criticism that they react to violence each time? @MattRedmore @MrHarryCole How do you know who was attacked? Or who the attackers were. @MrHarryCole @Hiddenheritage How dare anyone blame Islam...It is the Jews...or the Hindus? @MrHarryCole @GuidoFawkes This will be used to persecute innocents unfortunately @MrHarryCole @vinod_sharma muhammadan cunts are really really sensitive, they use stones instead of water every morning,it hurts/burns u see Nice to see a ""libertarian"" advocating community/ group responsibility. @MrHarryCole @Holbornlolz @Holbornlolz no I'm ok, but thanks for your concern @MrHarryCole @MrHarryCole @Eschertology knew NewsCorp be the first to react like that @mrharrycole @chandrusweb who? Obviously, followers of religion of peace @MrHarryCole a small, outlying gang of fanatics that bear no real relation to any larger movement, group of people or belief? What do I win? @teachertwit2 @MrHarryCole @GuidoFawkes Yeah like the 10 innocent people that have been killed @MrHarryCole @dylanllyr Why, do you know who did it? @MrHarryCole we have no idea yet, and speculation makes you look silly, remember Anders Brevik @Socialistdawn @MrHarryCole He never said he did @MattRedmore @MrHarryCole I was wondering why you listed so many types of people who had been attacked. We don't know who was shot @MrHarryCole You don't know who has been shot - it may have been lots of groups or just one. @Socialistdawn @MrHarryCole No he means attacked by the magazine. As in satirised @MattRedmore @MrHarryCole sorry I misread it. My foolishness. @unknown_callers @MrHarryCole @GuidoFawkes But one race is not ""better"" than another,there are other ways - ALL papers to print Hebdo fronts @AllenStarr1 quite, it's repeated invasions that were the problem @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno @Rolo_Tamasi @AllenStarr1 @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno Do you mean the invasion by Muslims into European Countries? #massImmigration @teachertwit2 @MrHarryCole @GuidoFawkes  Oh god let us hope so. @lacatchat @MrHarryCole No, Muslims should get the hell out @NegiJew @MrHarryCole @GuidoFawkes Just hope my god is not your god @NegiJew I hope you're just a troll, because if you're sincere you make me ashamed to be Jewish. @salvey1 @MrHarryCole Yeah, he killed a bunch of antisemitic pre-terrorists at the annual PLO-Norway tettorist Jamboree.  No Apologies @lacatchat If you feel ashamed by what another Jew does, you are doing it wrong.  http://t.co/UvmwZN8kU9 @NegiJew ah, just a troll then. Good good. @lacatchat I am not trolling at all.  There will be no peace until we send these people packing @NegiJew Whevs, troll. @lacatchat WW2 ended with the fully merited expulsion of 12 million germans from Czechia and Poland, followed by 50 years of peace @NegiJew I'm not listening to a word you say. That's what you need to understand. Why on earth would I, given where you started? @NegiJew if you genuinely want to engage with people you need to go about it differently. @NegiJew for now, I assume all you want is to cause upset and anger. That's trolling in my book. You need to earn people's attention, @NegiJew not demand it by attacking them. Good luck. @NegiJew no-one owes you the right to listen, least of all me. Bye bye. I'm going to continue judging you as dangerous and wrong. @lacatchat So aggrieved by the truth on twitter bye imma make some Rachel Corrie pancakes for breakfast @Klartext89 @AllenStarr1 @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno no. @NegiJew classic troll response. And I'm not aggrieved at all. I'm dismissing you out of hand. Different. :) @Rexgrrr8 @MrHarryCole @Holbornlolz Why is it nice? @lacatchat If I were trolling, and I am not, receiving an 8 part lecture would be a victory @NegiJew well done then. You've won. Good for you. It doesn't matter to me what you think one bit. :) @NegiJew it's a victory to prove you have nothing of value to say is it? Good for you. xxxxxxxxxxx @lacatchat Leave me alone if you are all mad, but I am not letting you get the last word @NegiJew I honestly don't understand why you people do it. What do you hope to achieve? Other than me thinking you're a waste of space? @NegiJew just to hurt someone a bit for a laugh, maybe? Well done you. @lacatchat Hopefully a Muslim.  It is shock therapy. @NegiJew ha! You big hypocrite. As if that's what matters here. @NegiJew well, what if I block you? That's what trolls like isn't it? Then you can go off feeling like you've achieved something of value. @NegiJew FFS. @lacatchat Idk lets be friends instead! @NegiJew but take this with you: you are doing nothing but damage. Like I said, trolling. Pathetic and irresponsible. @lacatchat I hate muslims and hope they go back go the planet tatooine @NegiJew I really meant it when I said I've written you off. It just upsets me that you have Jew in your name because you don't deserve it. @NegiJew but hey, that's trolls for you. They find a way to destroy what you love. @NegiJew why are you tweeting me, unless to get me to block you? Like I said, trolling. Meaningless words. @lacatchat You don't know anything about being Jewish @lacatchat No, you keep making my fucking cellphone beep @NegiJew troll @NegiJew Troll @Rolo_Tamasi @AllenStarr1 @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno No more questions, all said. You're clearly a moron. @Klartext89 that is one thing which, as a very clear matter of fact, is untrue. @AllenStarr1 @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno @rc_848 sarcasm @MrHarryCole @Holbornlolz @Rexgrrr8 @MrHarryCole @Holbornlolz Certainly makes more sense than a ""libertarian"" advocating top-down/governmental action. @rc_848 which libertarian is doing that? in what context? @MrHarryCole @Holbornlolz @Rolo_Tamasi @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno Didn't know journalists killed them. Thanks for head- oh wait you're a shit. @Rexgrrr8 @MrHarryCole @Holbornlolz None that I know of. That would be nonsense. @fitfeather1903 what are you trying to say? @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno @rc_848 police action is arguably top down, thats the appropriate response to this crime @MrHarryCole @Holbornlolz @fitfeather1903 BTW it does look as though I was right. @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno @Rolo_Tamasi @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno You want to justify the killing as if the journalists killed muslims. @fitfeather1903 do I? can you support that defamation with evidence?  @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno @Rexgrrr8 @MrHarryCole @Holbornlolz Ah, I now understand your ""group responsibility"" tweet (I think). A good point. @rc_848 cheers. Times like this when libertarians distinguish themselves fm bigots. @MrHarryCole @Holbornlolz @fitfeather1903 the reason you can't find evidence is that your statement was a complete and brainless lie @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno @Rolo_Tamasi @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno You're the one trying to justify an attack like this by putting one group in a muh victim spotlight. @fitfeather1903 you won't find anywhere that I've done that. You are just making it up and lying about me. @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno @Rolo_Tamasi @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno http://t.co/S8AjK6wSCy @fitfeather1903 please explain. @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno @fitfeather1903 you are exposing you're state of mind, not mine. @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno @Rolo_Tamasi @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno Ad hominem won't safe you now. You wanted proof. @fitfeather1903  and I'm still waiting for it. (wasn't the ad hom. attack yours?) @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno @Rolo_Tamasi @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno I just showed you the picture where you tried to use some sort of victim complex. But whatever. @fitfeather1903 but I didn't do that either. @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno @Rolo_Tamasi @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno Then what were you trying to say with the tweet? @fitfeather1903 let me give you a clue, do you think brainless violence justifies more brainless violence?@MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno @Rolo_Tamasi @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno No. Do you think one leads to the other? @fitfeather1903 then how can I possibly have been""justifying"" the attack?  @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno @Rolo_Tamasi @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno It just seems you were trying to give a reason for the attacks. @fitfeather1903 so you withdraw your lie that I was ""justifying"" or in anyway supporting the attack. @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno @Rolo_Tamasi @MrHarryCole @GazTheJourno Maybe justifying was indeed the wrong word. Trying to reason the attack is what I meant. @cridlyn debyg mai mwslemiaid blin oedden nhw. Yn anffodus, mae'r bygythiad wedi bod ers blynyddoedd @dylanllyr Ond doedd neb yn gwybod adeg y trydariad, fel wyt ti'n ymwybodol. @cridlyn Roedd syniad go dda o'r dechrau, o'r hyn dw i'n deall. Beth bynnag, mae'n ffaith ddigalon mai mater o amser yn unig oedd hyn. @lalashwa @MrHarryCole @Hiddenheritage I think it's the Jedi- that darned Force again....or it could be Mossad...or Area 51.. @gilchristawake @lalashwa @mrharrycole Try Martians! Now the Middle East will go.into denial mode. Will blame Jewish conspiracy. @Hiddenheritage @gilchristawake @lalashwa @MrHarryCole I slipped the other day and hurt myself......I had no option but to blame the Jews. @lacatchat @NegiJew you are a genuine fuckhead. Go back to posting photos about how you changed the colour of your cocksucking lips @leobrag123 that is literally the least intimidating tweet I've ever read. You'll have to try a LOT harder than that. @lacatchat I'm not trying to intimidate you. Sorry that it's not all about you, I'll try to pout and hopefully that ""intimidates"" you @leobrag123 what are you trying to do then? With your ""get off twitter"" stuff? Make a positive contribution to the world? Jeez. @leobrag123 Go for it. Unless you're too scared to show your face :-) @lacatchat speaking of positive contribution to the world.....
You're clearly in love with muslims and good luck to you supporting terrorism @lacatchat probably 1 or 2 muzzies who wouldn't mind stabbing me for lies I've exposed of theirs. They don't like when facts are leaked @leobrag123 You really don't understand do you? It genuinely doesn't matter to me what you say. It's completely meaningless. x @leobrag123 @Hiddenheritage @lalashwa @MrHarryCole they are pretty slippery-those Jews!",non-rumours
We strongly condemn the horrible shooting at #CharlieHebdo. We must all stand up for freedom of speech and expression. @Charlie_Hebdo_,"@alexstubb Ihmeiden aika ei ole ohi. Olen pääministerin kanssa kerrankin samaa mieltä. @alexstubb @reijoruokanen meillä on fiksu ja asiansa osaava pääministeri ;) @LiedesLotta @alexstubb No ei nyt sentään riemastuta tästä. @alexstubb @Charlie_Hebdo_ you are confusing  freedom of speech with freedom to offend @alexstubb You are confusing freedom of speech with freedom to offend what to others is inviolable or sacrosanct. #CharlieHebdo @sandripavli No, actually he's not. Making fun/satirising myths, fables, ideas, goes with the freedom of speech. @alexstubb @sandripavli If you're offended by something I say, it's really your problem. Thus ""freedom of speach"" @alexstubb @reijoruokanen @LiedesLotta @alexstubb Lotta vain ja ainoastaan totesi faktan. :) @sandripavli @alexstubb and who is the one deciding What is offence and What freedom if speech, you? @JuhaVirta1 @alexstubb Not certainly pseudo-cultural or pseudo-intellectual bullism. Who r u, who am I, who r they must nt be above respect. Correct. Bullying shouldn't be approved in the name of freedom of speech. #CharlieHebdo did wrong too. @sandripavli @JuhaVirta1 @alexstubb @TuomoMa @sandripavli @alexstubb He is, unfortunately. Bullying shouldn't be accepted in the name of freedom of speech. #CharlieHebdo @markusjuva Bullying??? The whole world should stop questioning (religious) ideas, coz 20% of the people might get offended? @sandripavli @markusjuva I take offence how the Muslims treat women and minorities, yet they are free to preach about it-&gt; freedom of speech @sandripavli .@markusjuva it's a sign of a civilised country that you can make fun of anyone. Incl. leaders &amp; certainly imaginary beings @sandripavli @TuomoMa @sandripavli Making fun / questioning, and being excessively vulgar, disrespectful and rude, are two completely different things. @TuomoMa @sandripavli Pointing out those things, is naturally ok. Involving obscene blasphemy and grossness, is not. @markusjuva Not in my / most of the civilised worlds book. Offence can not be given, it can only be taken. @sandripavli @markusjuva Blasphemy!? A law that an omnipotent, omniscient being wont get his feelings hurt. What a joke!! :-D @sandripavli @markusjuva Exactly, I just point them out, don't go shooting people. @sandripavli .@markusjuva That magazine satirised every major religion and world leader, yet only one of those groups murdered 13 people. @sandripavli @markusjuva Stop for a second and think. Since there's no law against what they did, you're saying it was ok to kill them? @sandripavli .@markusjuva They were even accused of anti-Semitism coz they made fun of Jews. I'm sure the Muslims laughed at those pictures. @sandripavli @markusjuva Islam forbids one to draw Muhammad. Fine. The people doing the drawing weren't Muslims, so the rule doesn't apply. @sandripavli .@markusjuva If this Allan akubar exists, those cartoonist would suffer forever after their NATURAL death. That knowledge should be enough. @TuomoMa @sandripavli No, a law, that majority of people (and all existing cultures), would have right to have smt sacred still. @TuomoMa @sandripavli Yup, but these #immoral ""artists"" at #CharlieHebdo, did much worse things without any taste or limits. @TuomoMa @sandripavli Sure, they can not be killed multiple times. But it's true, there is aggression problem in extreme jihadists. @TuomoMa @sandripavli Some douchebag might have laughed, doesn't make the pictures right then again. @TuomoMa @sandripavli Heh, maybe you have to stop now. Where did I say anything like it was ok to kill them? @TuomoMa @sandripavli I'm not speaking about that. I'm speaking, that it has nothing to do with freedom of speech, but severe bullyism. @TuomoMa Here you're partly right, and defo it was #incorrect to kill anyone, but to accept what they draw and martyring them, is wrong too. @markusjuva But since it's a different thing to different people, we'll end up in a society that can't ridicule anything. @sandripavli @markusjuva ""If you don't want your beliefs to be ridiculed, don't have such ridiculous beliefs"" - someone @sandripavli @markusjuva @sandripavli We'll end up with this. http://t.co/zTTrvtsXkq @TuomoMa @markusjuva One of most important things humans have in common is: difference! Learn to respect that above unilateral emancipation. @TuomoMa @sandripavli Höpsis. There should be limits to everything, also to restrictions, but have respect and understanding towards others. @markusjuva Prove to me your version of god exists and he's worth worshipping and then I'll consider not ridiculing him/her/it @sandripavli @markusjuva If it truly was a #religionofpeace wouldn't their extremists be extremely peaceful? #islam  @sandripavli @TuomoMa @sandripavli That's not the point, but to respect (also) those who have something sacred in their lives. You can ridicule theories. @TuomoMa @sandripavli In this case not, because of #ingnorance. Holy war actually means war against the enemies of ones #soul. @markusjuva ""aggression problem"" That's quite an understatement, but yes, yes there is. @sandripavli @markusjuva I'd bet quite a few ""douchebags"" laughed. That makes it hypocrisy. And still they are just cartoons. @sandripavli @TuomoMa @sandripavli You can express it better – no means to understate, but it's not the core of #Islam nor of the message of the Prophet. @markusjuva If your faith/religion is so weak that it can't handle cartoons, no matter what they depict, not much of a religion @sandripavli @TuomoMa @sandripavli Well you can bet and you may be right, but the laughers are fools too, as are the drawers, who crossed many limits. @markusjuva You mean people like this?  @sandripavli http://t.co/spsSDVJWSn @TuomoMa @sandripavli Well the reactions of course vary, only a fool rages, but it still doesn't make severe disrespect correct. @TuomoMa @sandripavli No, he's much worse than a douchebag. @markusjuva By the way, that's a police officer they're executing.

And a Muslim. @sandripavli @TuomoMa @sandripavli I know. Tragical, but doesn't make much difference which profession/religion he/she has in this case. @markusjuva You didn't, there's a question mark. There are laws against spewing shit about people, doesn't apply to sky fairies @sandripavli @markusjuva If you don't want #freedomofspeech to include ridiculing beliefs there are 2 things you can do. 1. Move to a -&gt; @sandripavli @markusjuva &gt; country that doesn't have it. There's plenty to choose from. Or. 2. Try to change things democratically. I'll -&gt; @sandripavli @markusjuva &gt;just say it's a sad day when that happens and then we won't have freedom anymore. @sandripavli @markusjuva If they had been doing it only about a single (actual) person the law would have interfered. And rightly so. @sandripavli @markusjuva Bullying a belief? :-D @sandripavli @markusjuva If they had been satirising only Islam/Muslims, I'd kinda see your point. @sandripavli @markusjuva I disagree. And thank goodness, so does most of the civilised world. @TuomoMa @sandripavli Sky fairies is your unnecessary rhetorics. For many people some things are sacred, whether you understand it or not. @TuomoMa @sandripavli So should a bully have a right to bully his class mate, because of #FreedomOfSpeech? @TuomoMa @sandripavli It was still completely tasteless and stupid. Now they are dead. @TuomoMa @sandripavli Yup, but for someone to whom nothing is sacred, this might be too difficult to understand. @TuomoMa @sandripavli Why? Would it make it more right, if Rolle would bully also Niilo and Asko, besides Ismo? @TuomoMa Well most haven't (fortunately) seen all the pics, and it's a stupid trend and a rootless ignorance, too. #FreeVietnam @sandripavli Viva la difference! But my mouth shouldn't be gagged just because of someone's unsubstantiated beliefs on a ""god"" @markusjuva @markusjuva There should be limits to things, but not free speech. @sandripavli @TuomoMa @sandripavli Gagged and good-taste-and-respectfulness-expected are two different things. Again and still. @markusjuva People deserve respect, belief systems/religion doesn't. @sandripavli @TuomoMa @sandripavli So should one be able to bully as much as one wants in school, because of #FreedomOfSpeech? @TuomoMa @sandripavli Well that's your opinion, and your still in far minority with that ""belief"". #Luckily @markusjuva If believe something, a cartoon shouldn't be able to shake that belief. Nothing sacred about Mohammad. @sandripavli @markusjuva You might offend something I hold ""sacred"", but I'll fight for your right to say it. @sandripavli @markusjuva So people can stop calling it a #religionofpeace. Thanks, I'll tell them. @sandripavli @markusjuva Prove to me a soul exists. Gibberish. @sandripavli @TuomoMa @sandripavli Nothing sacred to you, but you fail to understand, that lots of sacred to some others. #understanding #respect @markusjuva Yet these people follow quran more to the letter than a moderate Muslim. The bible is full of hate too. More so @sandripavli @TuomoMa @sandripavli But it seems you haven't anything, and if you did, sincerely, I'd try not to disrespect it. @markusjuva Don't agree. The limits set by Islam? France is not an Islamic country. @sandripavli @TuomoMa @sandripavli And once again, saying about an issue, or meaningfully insulting about something, are different things. @TuomoMa @sandripavli Why? Did you get it wrong what I meant? And why sarcasm, it's again just proof of weakness. @markusjuva Btw, if you believe in the bible you're going to hell. You called them fools. Google it, if you can't remember your scripture. @TuomoMa @sandripavli The proof is inside of our selves, and only there. Prove it to your self and stop being childish. You'd enjoy it. @TuomoMa @sandripavli #Mohammad didn't write #Quran, #Christ didn't write #Bible.
#Islam
#Christianity
#Dogmas
#Ignorance @markusjuva Apropos of nothing, at this moment a writer is receiving the first 40 of 1000 lashes in Saudi Arabia for blasphemy. @sandripavli @TuomoMa @sandripavli The limits are set by the common sense of the wise. @TuomoMa @sandripavli Or actually correction here; they are set by Someone else, but can be understood by those wise who have common sense. @TuomoMa Lol, why would I be that interested what the bible says? :D @TuomoMa @sandripavli That's not good, that's wrong, and can be ridiculed. @markusjuva Like I said, thankfully disrespect is still included in the freedom of speech. And it ought to be. @sandripavli @markusjuva Disrespect of an idea, a belief. There's a huge difference with disrespecting humans. @sandripavli @TuomoMa @sandripavli These things are international and crossing borders anyway. They are actually #universal, but let's stick to earth ;) @TuomoMa @sandripavli But it's wrong. Why would it ought to be? @markusjuva Agreed. Much worse than anything anyone ever drew on paper. Yet he/she can express her/his feelings. @sandripavli @TuomoMa @sandripavli How? Why wouldn't for someone spiritual, a belief be more important, than for example looks or other shallow things? @markusjuva No, because he's dead. Killed by another Muslim. Guess they'll meet in paradise, huh? @sandripavli @markusjuva There's nothing to understand. Just unsubstantiated claims. @sandripavli @markusjuva If 1 is offended by my views, it's her/his problem. Mute me on twitter. Doesn't give you a right to kill me though. @sandripavli @TuomoMa @sandripavli But will have to (hopefully) pay it for society, and anyway for his/hers Maker and #conscience. @markusjuva You're the only one claiming the cartoons were ""bullying"". They are not. @sandripavli @TuomoMa @sandripavli Surely not. @markusjuva https://t.co/7DdxnSYHnj @sandripavli @TuomoMa @sandripavli That's your belief, for which you have freedom, though it might be silly. @TuomoMa @sandripavli Sure, there are scales and limits. #CharlieHebdo crossed many, but of course doesn't justify killings. @TuomoMa @sandripavli Really? I'm the only one? #Hmmmmmmmmmmmm @markusjuva Tasteless? Stupid? Depends who u ask. But they certainly had the right to say it.

Yes they are dead, murdered by theists. @TuomoMa @sandripavli So if a bully bullies also others, anyone shouldn't feel offended? @TuomoMa ""Certainly had the right""... well, according to you and some others, yes, then again according to some others, not. @markusjuva Never said that. Just coz I see through the bull shit that is religion, doesn't mean that. @sandripavli @markusjuva Unless Niilo, Asko and Ismo are belief systems, I don't see the comparison. @sandripavli @markusjuva Besides, you're still the only one calling what they did ""bullying"" @sandripavli @TuomoMa @sandripavli You'll see, easily, if you want. It's about hurting someones deep feelings and important sacred things. @TuomoMa @sandripavli I might not know better word, but could write about it more than 140 letters easily. And only one? Knowledge? @TuomoMa @markusjuva I'm a non religious too &amp; also convinced that religion is bullshit, but people that belong to it aren't full of shit. @markusjuva Never heard of Charlie hebdo before, now you can not see those pictures. So that worked well. Seen quite a few. @markusjuva Not to me. Like I said, people deserve respect, ideas don't.  @sandripavli @markusjuva I wonder who's doing this and if the people in the market drew a picture? @sandripavli @markusjuva Again, you're the one calling it bullying. And those students are people, not ideas. And if they say something, -&gt; @sandripavli @markusjuva &gt;to authorities, something will be done. #CharlieHebdo not bullying though, only in your mind. @sandripavli @TuomoMa @markusjuva Seems that in you mr.Tuo/mio (yours/mine), you are more mine. I'll leave u 2 gentlemen go on. Markus nice to meet you. @markusjuva In the civilised world? Can you show me some statistics? @markusjuva Nice assumption. Let's say I hold the equality of all humans, men, women, LGBT sacred. Most religions are against that. -&gt; @markusjuva &gt;will you defends me like this when I shoot as many theists as I possibly can? #hypotheticalsituation @markusjuva But if you did disrespect it, I'd defend your right to say how you feel about it. @TuomoMa Yes, it's true, everybody lost. @markusjuva @sandripavli http://t.co/pfWmDmU7rS @markusjuva Satire is probably the oldest for of ridiculing the powers that be. Nothing someone says gives the ""butt hurt"" a right to kill. @markusjuva No, I understood perfectly. Thanks. @TuomoMa Well ""civilized"" can be seen in far different ways. For me middle class Indian is 100 times more civilized than mid-class american. @markusjuva Prove a negative? Prove something there's no proof of, doesn't exist? Prove to me unicorns don't exist. @markusjuva Did I say they did? @markusjuva :-D :-D So you ARE a comedian. @TuomoMa You hold it a human right, not a sacred thing. The other things has roots in centuries and millenniums back. @markusjuva Again, why should I live by the rules someone randomly thinks of? The law I get, it's thought of and mostly agreed on. @TuomoMa The funny thing is (or actually sad), that you still fail to see that I'm not defending anyon, just condemning #CharlieHebdo, too. @markusjuva Don't know, hence the word ""if"". @TuomoMa But if I did, I'd do wrong, and the correct thing would be to correct me then. @markusjuva Why would anyone be? @TuomoMa @sandripavli ""Everyones beliefs"", and the main religions central path, are again those famous #TwoDifferentThings @markusjuva :-D Double standards much? He did exactly the same thing. Blasphemy. He's not dead though. Yet. @TuomoMa Did I ever say, it would give? Are you focusing at all, or maybe drunk? @TuomoMa Then your answer was absurd. .@markusjuva If a tribe from Papua New Guinea said that's trees, &amp; subsequently paper, is ""sacred"" to them, would you stop wiping your ass? @TuomoMa I don't have to. But to have proof and knowledge of the #Spirit for oneself, is everything. I sincerely recommend. @TuomoMa No, why you're asking? :D @TuomoMa I actually corrected it. .@markusjuva Once we start telling what you can and can't say, we no longer have #FreedomOfSpeech That would be a disaster. @TuomoMa Well that #CharlieHebdo thing should have been outlawed, but yes, if one has common sense, one understands. @TuomoMa Yeah, if you don't know, now you know ;) @TuomoMa Not many good reasons, though some nice guidelines if one can discriminate. @markusjuva I'm not saying it can't be, but if your beliefs are unsubstantiated, I have the right to ridicule them. Not him/her, the beliefs @TuomoMa I meant that this kind of actions can and should be ridiculed, and for about fifth time, I have never justified any killings. @markusjuva How? She's/he's nameless, faceless? ""If"" there isn't a maker, who will she/he be responsible to? Do you seriously this his/her-&gt; @TuomoMa Yeah, I can use water for them. @markusjuva &gt; conscience is going to give him/her trouble for that? He/She believes he's/she's right. #belief #religion @TuomoMa So we can bully our class mates now? @markusjuva Why not? He was killed in the line of duty, heroic death. The killer was doing what the quran tells him to do. @TuomoMa But for example Christ didn't do wrong, only humans in the name of Him. So ridiculing his character, is tasteless and wrong. @markusjuva If anything, the police is not going to paradise. http://t.co/S6zd1tjbqu @TuomoMa Yes, it will, no doubt about that, and do not worry my little friend :D .@markusjuva No, it's a fact. Give me a single peer reviewed piece of evidence that proves any of the 3000 or so gods. @TuomoMa But the #Quran was not written by #Muhammed, if you can recall a bit backwards. @TuomoMa Don't believe everything what quran says, and especially, don't believe everything you read from the #internet.
#FreeAdvice @markusjuva Even though it's actually not a belief, you call call it silly all you want. Because of #freedomofspeech @markusjuva Show me a law that says they crossed a limit. @TuomoMa It's not a fact, but your belief. The only proof is inside of your soul, and only you can find it, no-one will find it for you. @TuomoMa Sure. On the other hand, I'm also right. @markusjuva First one I've talked to. Why the sarcasm? It makes you look weak. @TuomoMa Same thing, if you search it deep enough from inside your soul, you'll easily understand. But okay; would Mandela agree with those? @markusjuva Wow, you got to use the word ""bully"" twice in this tweet. #notevenbullying @TuomoMa There's scales and limits in sarcasm, too. This your post has more sarcasm, than the mine you're answering, don't you think? @TuomoMa Yeah, and you're being sarcastic two messages in a row and avoiding the point with it completely! @TuomoMa But will you be able to answer this, or? @markusjuva And according to the law, yes. :-) @markusjuva No, I don't see the point in your faulty ""school ground bullying"" analogy. @markusjuva No one should be silenced in case they might hurt someones ""important sacred"" thingies. @markusjuva Ok, only one I've seen so far. @sandripavli Never said they are. People deserve respect. Myths, fables and imaginary beings don't. @markusjuva @markusjuva Well maybe not 100 times, but more civilised absolutely. The U.S. is not on MY civilised countries list. Most of it anyway. @markusjuva Are you saying it can't be sacred to me? Things evolve, we should too. A book written by people who didn't know what stars were&gt; @markusjuva &gt;shouldn't be considered ""sacred"" anymore. @markusjuva I get that, but condemning the victim in this case is to me almost as bad. Who are you to condemn them anyway? They broke no law @TuomoMa Maybe french laws, which is stupid, from #France. #CharlieHebdo @TuomoMa Why not, it's ""freedom of speech"" to say what one wants, isn't it? @markusjuva If you broke a law, yes. I wouldn't argue your right to say it though. @TuomoMa That's again your belief/opinion. Can you see there's starting to be repetition pattern here? @markusjuva 

----- the point ----&gt;

You. @TuomoMa It's not about the books, it's about God, and in the end, it doesn't make much difference to know the stars, but to know one self. @markusjuva You are claiming I should respect all people and their beliefs. I'm saying no, I don't. The Klan believes things too. @TuomoMa They are victim for the shootings, but wrong doers in the big picture. Along with other extremists, of course. @TuomoMa Yes, you see the man made laws, not the Divine laws nor even ""laws of nature"". @markusjuva No you didn't. I said how I feel about the subject.

Do you mean concentrating?

Sadly, no I'm not :-( @TuomoMa Not sure what you're meaning here, please explain, got curious. @markusjuva :-D @TuomoMa We shouldn't accept nor respect wrong or wrong doings, but no reason to insult for example Christ or Muhammed. They did no wrong. @markusjuva No you don't &amp; you can't. Just like I don't have to believe in your ""soul"" coz you can't prove it. @markusjuva Again, just your beliefs. You can believe in this ""spirit"" mumbo jumbo and I can ridicule it. @markusjuva Coz you tweeted all of a sudden this general knowledge tidbit and I was wondering if I had anything to do with this brain fart. @markusjuva Ah :-( So you aren't :-/ @TuomoMa Certainly, but you can give it a chance; find it and realize it, so you don't have to believe, you'll just comfortably know. @markusjuva So that's ""common sense"" as you define it. Riiiiight @TuomoMa Sure, but the happy thing for me is that I don't have to believe in it, I just know it. #Lucky &amp; #Blessed @markusjuva Good to know. @TuomoMa Yup, you had, as you suddenly started brain farting some stuff about some books, and it even lasted some time. @markusjuva Discriminate??? Do you mean cherry pick? @TuomoMa Sure I am, but also a philosopher. It was poorly expressed earlier. @TuomoMa One should find the ""rules"" from one's heart, then common sense occurs. Not from mind, but heart. @markusjuva :-D Sure you would! What if you're in a public toilet and there's no water in the booth? @TuomoMa Of course, who would blindly accept anything, especially dogmas. @markusjuva Really, you should stop with this analogy. It makes no sense. @TuomoMa There's probably leafs or someones shirt nearby for help. @markusjuva If someone is attacking beliefs, he has the right to do so. If he's attacking a person, he doesn't. @TuomoMa No it doesn't, it's a ""freedom of speech"", according to #JeSuisCharlie -people. @markusjuva Well, if Christ and god are the same thing, as many believe, he did plenty wrong. @TuomoMa How many times you want to repeat that low-level belief of yours? @TuomoMa Christ is a son of God, as many believes, but lets not get into that, as you don't believe it. @markusjuva Besides, Christ is not the belief system. A Christian god is and according to the bible he's an asshole. @markusjuva I really don't think it will. I doubt he/she believes in your ""spirit"". Worry? Me? Hah. @markusjuva Again, where did I say it was? Or is this another one of your ""general knowledge tidbits""? @markusjuva Ah, another ""general knowledge tidbit"". I'm starting to enjoy them. @TuomoMa So don't ridicule Christ, ridicule Bible. @markusjuva Tell that to the jihadists. Who are u to tell anyone what to believe from the quran? Don't you respect their beliefs? #hypocrite @TuomoMa ""Thinking is no means of knowing the absolute truth"" @markusjuva Are you telling me the claims for any god are not unsubstantiated? Go on then, give evidence proving any god. @TuomoMa Well it is, as you're still referring to quran as it would mean something in our conversation. @TuomoMa Sure, when you learn to use these in practice, you'll enjoy your life more. @markusjuva Like I said, first you have to prove a ""soul"" exists, before you can even advice me what to do with it. @markusjuva Is this ""soul"" business something they tell you in these ""spirit"" classes? @markusjuva No! You're not! #tweetlikeasixyearold Hmmm, maybe you ARE a comedian after all. @markusjuva Bed time for me. Will return. Bye for now. :-) @TuomoMa No, I don't exactly respect dogmas, but doesn't mean I'd go insulting them. But the point was not to insult Christ/Muhammed/etc... @TuomoMa I've already told, that the only proof is inside one's soul. No use repeating these things over and over. @TuomoMa Like I've said (probably many times), it cannot be proven, but only to one self. Please stop repeating yourself. @TuomoMa No, there's no business and there's no classes. @TuomoMa Same here, need some sleep now. @markusjuva More of this ""soul"" thing, huh? @markusjuva It's all scales and limits with you. Sarcasm is sarcasm, apparently I'm not allowed to do it and you're. -&gt; @markusjuva &gt; but it's ok, we now know you have double standards. #hypocrite #limitsandscalesman @markusjuva There's no point in your bully nonsense. It's a bad analogy. You bully. #seeiusedittwicetoo @markusjuva So the French law is stupid? :-D Should it be replaced with sharia? #notacomedian @markusjuva I don't know what kind of school you went to, but the school bullies I've seen rarely were into ""words"" or arguments. @markusjuva That's why, for the umpteenth time, it's A B-A-D A-N-A-L-O-G-Y @markusjuva My opinion, the opinion of a civilised society and the way the law sees it. BOOM. Sorry. @markusjuva You're free to try and change it, move or live with it. There's no ifs or buts. No ""bullies"". Those are your choices. #notsorry @markusjuva Yes I see the repetition. Unfortunately for you, the law agrees with me. Thankfully. @markusjuva Is it? Which god is that. I'm really more interested why the stars are there, than any book of bull shit. @markusjuva And so should anyone living in the 21st century. We're done with myths, time for facts. @markusjuva Again, they broke no law. You didn't answer me, who are you to condemn them, if they broke no law? @markusjuva :-D Stupidest tweet of the day! You want to go with the ""divine"" law? Sharia? Haha Did you read your tweet before pressing send? @markusjuva I did, in my next tweet. Besides I'm still laughing at this gem https://t.co/BuZ0oLvUeX @markusjuva I didn't say anything about wrong doings. Don't move the goalposts. We've been talking about beliefs the whole time. @markusjuva And you say we should respect everyones beliefs. I gave you an example. The Klan. Should we respect their beliefs? @markusjuva Muhammad was a pedophile. Says so in the quran. :-D ""Did nothing wrong"" haha @markusjuva There, I just gave it chance. No sign of it. You know why? Coz it doesn't exists. @markusjuva Yeah, just like any theist in the world. ""Oh, I just know. He lives in my soul."" :-D @markusjuva Hehe, had to come back to this. Can you see the desperation in your tweet? Clasping for straws much? ""Divine law"" :-D @markusjuva I guess I'm #lucky &amp; #blessed coz I see the world as it is. @markusjuva Hit a nerve? @markusjuva You must be good.

Now there's some sarcasm for you ;-) @markusjuva Sorry, this is even more stupid than the ""divine law"" tweet. I'm sure the killers searched their ""heart"" and look what happened. @markusjuva :-D Someones shirt? Dude, you need to sacrifice yours I'm afraid. No one's gonna give you their shirt at that point. @markusjuva U said I don't hold anything sacred &amp; I said I do. You know what it is? Paper. Better to keep an extra shirt with u from now on. @markusjuva I mean, you don't want to disrespect my beliefs do you? @markusjuva I didn't forbid you to use it. I said it's a bad analogy, which it is. @markusjuva As many as I need to. How many times are you gonna mention this non-existent soul? @markusjuva Yes, but many denominations of Christianity believe that god, christ, holy spirit all same thing, god. #generalknowledgetidbit @markusjuva But the bible is infallible word of god, isn't it? And if jésus = god, the bible proves he's an asshole. @markusjuva So the quran had nothing to do with the mindset of the killers? Ah, so you're an apologist. Makes sense. @markusjuva Please, stop with the condescending bull shit. You know nothing of me or what I enjoy. #spiritguide @markusjuva You just contradicted yourself. @markusjuva No use repeating this ""soul"" BS without proof. So you're a ""do as I say, don't do as I do"" -type of guy, huh? @markusjuva Repeating myself? You keep bringing up this non-existent ""soul"". @markusjuva So what's the con then??? @markusjuva Sorry to come back to this, but have you read Deuteronomy and Leviticus? These are the laws you respect? Or sharia? @markusjuva If the actions of the cartoonists were lawful (and they were), -&gt; @markusjuva &gt; discussing the content of the cartoons is a lot like discussing what the woman was wearing when she got raped. @markusjuva Ok. I think we're done here anyway. I will read your tweets and think about them, but won't comment any further. -&gt; @markusjuva &gt; I think everything's been said and maybe a bit more. I also think it's clear neither of us will change their mind. @markusjuva I'll finish with these quotes from the very smart @aliamjadrizvi Have a good one. http://t.co/hDMnX98WYA @TuomoMa Well alcoholics who choose welfare and prostitutes and school bullies might not brake law – I still not approve their doings. @TuomoMa No, I thought you're smarter than that, I underestimated you, sorry. Forget the ""Divine"" then, just focus on the nature/natural. @TuomoMa No, you have been talking about beliefs, not me. Take your narcissistic head out of your arse and see the outside for a while. @TuomoMa You forgot the consept ""sincerety"". Must be difficult. @TuomoMa I don't need to guess, but descending for these conversations after your low blows makes me feel bit silly that's true. @TuomoMa Not at all. What happened in between the break, I feel you're getting more lower and lack any kind of essence from your posts? @TuomoMa Yes, rudeness is weak mans imitation of strentgh. @TuomoMa Well it's stupid for those who won't get it. I told you, I underestimated you. Forget fairies, think Mandela or Gandhi then. @TuomoMa And no they didn't. One could say ""heart full of anger"", but digging deep and searching the essence will cleanse it. @TuomoMa You reall continue even with this? @TuomoMa No it isn't, I should have known better; you're just one more christian atheist dissapointed. @TuomoMa Probably it did, but Mohammad didn't write it. So ridicule bible and quran, not Christ nor Mohammad. That's my point all over. @TuomoMa I know a lot already from this conversation, but what prevents you of stopping? @TuomoMa No I didn't, you just won't get it. @TuomoMa Another completely failed #CircularArgument. @TuomoMa Have could I prove you that love, other emotions or for example mind exists? @TuomoMa Silly argument. But I answered to this already with the alcoholic welfare guy- / prostitue- / school bully example. @TuomoMa This is not needed. I'm not anyhow justifying the terror attacks and the deaths, just not accepting the martyrism or heroism -› @TuomoMa -› of theirs, and saying that their ""art"" was (at least partly) discusting, immoral, not needed, uncalled, non beneficial -› @TuomoMa -› and what it came to some of the worst ones: extremely insulting and obscenely ugly. @TuomoMa And he seems to be far from smart, when Some who are considered holy and widely loved, can be insulted like that. @aliamjadrizvi",non-rumours

"Quran says: Whoever kills an innocent soul.. it is as if they had killed the entire humanity.
#CharlieHebdo #Paris http://t.co/UinZ805MpA","@robbieloser It does. But the idiots who commit such terrorism don't care about that. Hence, don't care about Islam. It's just a mask. @ATEEKSTER Well, just convince yourself those souls ain't innocent. Makes the killing just again... @nigelstwits @ElPiett @nigelstwits Only sick people would do that. Unfortunately, those are the idiots that get publicized. @ATEEKSTER This violence imo is just as inherent to any religion as acts of charity are. History is proof of that @ATEEKSTER problem is what the Quran also says about those who insult Allah and the prophet. @Smienos @djehoety @Smienos No it doesnt. Go read a translated version of the Quran. See for yourself exactly what it teaches. You've nothing to lose @ATEEKSTER I've done so, multiple times, it's so double. Parts are beautiful, others well, are not. Will look into it when home. @Smienos @djehoety @Smienos Thank you. Appreciate it. @ATEEKSTER  it also says ""Kill those who insult islam "" Qur'an (33:61)  #CharlieHebdo @ATEEKSTER Loved your #Paris Post hy Not post on http://t.co/tXGMBRYHGX Proximity Based Travel Network? @mikepenrod http://t.co/IUikoPjSUJ @Don_Macanudo Actually: Accursed wherever they are found, being seized &amp; massacred completely.

And please don't take verses out of context. @ATEEKSTER accursed &amp; massacred ( with a Kalashnikov. ) exactly what they did. @Don_Macanudo Please read the verses before and after and not take one single verse out of context. Thank you for your understanding. .@ATEEKSTER @jabial they'll say those killed weren't innocent; whereas the Bible says unconditionnally: you shall not kill @ATEEKSTER @triplenickel the counter argument is trivial: they insulted the prophet, so they are not innocent #duh @ATEEKSTER @foxllwynog Then these chaps should learn to read it. Are they viewed as heretics by Muslims then? @tommallow1 @ATEEKSTER They are by many followers of Islam - The BBC etc. don't give them publicity either. Easier to demonise for ConUKIP @libertates @ATEEKSTER That's a bad translation from Hebrew. It's thou shalt not murder. @jabial @ATEEKSTER doesn't change the problem of unconditionnality @ATEEKSTER @Don_Macanudo well said bro @tommallow1 @foxllwynog Let me put it this way if all Muslims thought the way those people did we'd have a billion terrorists. Majority are? @FadyK85 @Don_Macanudo My pleasure.. Even though you're a Chelsea supporter lol @ATEEKSTER @tommallow1 Unfortunatelly Islam has the same problem as the West many with little understanding being manipulated by evil men. @ATEEKSTER @foxllwynog So what is the answer to my question. Are these killers regarded as heroes or villains by the Muslim in the street? @foxllwynog @tommallow1 It's those who are angry, frustrated, hopeless &amp; lost who are easily manipulated. @tommallow1 @foxllwynog Oh definitely villains. @foxllwynog @ATEEKSTER Outcasts make the best followers. Look at Robin Hood and Hitler @tommallow1 @ATEEKSTER In the same way as it has become common in the USA to say 'thank you for your service' it varies greatly. @ATEEKSTER @tommallow1 @foxllwynog given the magazines bullying of the prophet, I suspect most moderates while against are less sympathetic @ATEEKSTER @tommallow1 When the main source of education can be taken over by militants who corrupt text...... @ATEEKSTER @foxllwynog But who dare criticise a man with a gun. If it is Che or Mao or Hitler or a Muslim extremist. So the violent win? @foxllwynog @ATEEKSTER @tommallow1 Easy to do to those who live in hell on earth. We can blame that, in part, to political exploitation. @Kaz4Wokingham @tommallow1 @foxllwynog I'm moderate..

And who was the punishment taken out on? @Kaz4Wokingham @foxllwynog @tommallow1 @ATEEKSTER Was it the drone pilots punished? or someone random? @Kaz4Wokingham @foxllwynog @tommallow1 @ATEEKSTER random violence begetting random violence = escelation of violence @Kaz4Wokingham @foxllwynog @tommallow1 @ATEEKSTER and as ghandi said, ""an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind"" @LozDawney @Kaz4Wokingham @tommallow1 @ATEEKSTER And at the oposite end we should have left Poland to it's fate and left Hitler alone? @foxllwynog @Kaz4Wokingham @tommallow1 @ATEEKSTER Well it was hitler and his followers who did evil, and they alone who should be punished @foxllwynog @Kaz4Wokingham @tommallow1 @ATEEKSTER as it was... @foxllwynog @Kaz4Wokingham @tommallow1 @ATEEKSTER and it was done to protect their victims, not to avenge @LozDawney @Kaz4Wokingham @tommallow1 @ATEEKSTER So it is only the 'controlling minds' not just those following orders? @foxllwynog @Kaz4Wokingham @tommallow1 @ATEEKSTER ""and his followers"" @foxllwynog @Kaz4Wokingham @tommallow1 @ATEEKSTER But what of someone who has done neither? what if they just happen to live the same @LozDawney @Kaz4Wokingham @tommallow1 @ATEEKSTER The trial of Lord HawHaw (sp) negates the protection argument. @ATEEKSTER @Don_Macanudo haha thanks brother.

We have extremist as in any religion. @mikotheboss @mother1and @ExSydney @Telegraph I don't see Muslims demonstrating against terrorism, but they did about a film! @teresedau1 @mother1and @ExSydney@Telegraph In addition, our religion prohibits us from killing and asked us to discuss ideas by ideas-cont. @teresedau1 @mother1and @ExSydney@Telegraph &amp;not to return back insults. Freedom doesn't mean insulting other religions and believes-cont. @teresedau1 @mother1and @ExSydney @Telegraph .I'm totally against terrorizing &amp;killing people for their ideas &amp;the same goes to all Muslims. @teresedau1 @mother1and @ExSydney @Telegraph  Although i'm totally against what they published but i'm shocked that people has been killed @teresedau1 @mother1and @ExSydney @Telegraph for expressing their ideas.

I would reject this type of religion, but u defend it! @teresedau1  I'm from Egypt,&amp;u know that we are facing attacks from terrorists so I can understand ur feeling but we demonstrate for freedom @teresedau1 in addition, i'm with u in part that Muslims are emotional for any insult to its religion so why others don't respect this. @mikotheboss @mother1and You're telling me what 2 say! FREEDOM OF SPEECH. Nah! 'I'll shoot you if I don't like what u say!' @France @teresedau1 @mother1and  and who told u that ISIS represents Islam.

And not alone.  We need to do something. @OllieFunnell @joeshawty @aamer045 @iyad_elbaghdadi Agree. Dont ccriticize me! @Budman16 where does it say that? chapter? verse? hadith? @aamer045 @iyad_elbaghdadi @jpnoelhk @OllieFunnell no bro! Mocking religion is against ethics cause hate in socieity @aamer045 @OllieFunnell @joeshawty @iyad_elbaghdadi mine especially! @aamer045 Ahhh yes. The freedom of speech and expression. Have a Blessed day aamer. 
@Graham_Booth http://t.co/oCgX90lUsg @strangeeisbeast @MelissaTweets @ericdondero @iyad_elbaghdadi but also sometimes because of it. Herein lies the difference @jpnoelhk @OllieFunnell @joeshawty @iyad_elbaghdadi i may criticise but sure no disrespect or mocking.u can criticize but in respectable way @KetanVora4 @Budman16 @iyad_elbaghdadi article of scholar u were referring back provide it @KetanVora4 @aamer045 @iyad_elbaghdadi http://t.co/9cuG1mllnh @aamer045 will do @Budman16 @iyad_elbaghdadi @aamer045 @OllieFunnell Mocking religion is dangerous, that's for sure. Why do religious people hate people from other religions/atheist? @jpnoelhk @OllieFunnell religion people r at odds with atheists may be Thats Why but hate and disrespect r two different things @aamer045 @OllieFunnell @joeshawty @iyad_elbaghdadi All very subjective criteria. The bullets shot in the name of Allah were all too real! @jpnoelhk @OllieFunnell @joeshawty @iyad_elbaghdadi u answered in previous tweet @strangeeisbeast @iyad_elbaghdadi @MelissaTweets Is it too much to ask that we lose the Political Correctness for 1 day? It was Muslims @aamer045 @OllieFunnell Very much so. Fortunately (sort of..), only the religious use guns @iyad_elbaghdadi @flinx15 You can't be serious @Lapid1 That's selective understanding in a nutshell! #CharlieHebdo @ericdondero @iyad_elbaghdadi @MelissaTweets is it to much to ask for everyone being valued the same have you mentioned the 38 in Yemen? @ericdondero @iyad_elbaghdadi @MelissaTweets oh no that's Muslims dead, your logic is basically Muslims being victims of terrorism @ericdondero @iyad_elbaghdadi @MelissaTweets is acceptable but when it's someone else is the victims you can blame it on Muslims it's a @ericdondero @iyad_elbaghdadi @MelissaTweets tragedy both events are horrendous and deserve to be executed but not a whole religion @charliemonson @iyad_elbaghdadi @NickKristof You're the hero of the day with this amazing thought. What the fuck is wrong with ppl like U? @aamer045 @OllieFunnell @joeshawty @iyad_elbaghdadi No mocking nor disrespect intended, but this would also be subjective so I apologize @MarcuMalmb @iyad_elbaghdadi @flinx15 Do you ever think that killing innocent it's offensive ? Or much more offensive than something?Do you? @jpnoelhk @OllieFunnell communists were and are not religious.yesterday one blew herself up in Turkey! @imgelem @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham they just said ' Allah u akbar' @Lapid1 @iyad_elbaghdadi @flinx15 Of course its offensive but U don't seem to get his point. He's condemning their actions. @Medinhovic Bush&amp;Netenyahu killed millions in the name of Christianism&amp;Judaism.can u blame religious&amp;believers @iyad_elbaghdadi @BenAksar @aamer045 @OllieFunnell Yep. Attacking police, while not right, feels more like a fight than shooting civilians cartoonists somehow @MarcuMalmb @iyad_elbaghdadi @flinx15 I do not think kill people it's offensive, I think it's a crime vs people and all Goods. @imgelem @iyad_elbaghdadi @BenAksar first of all im not american, and secondly do you have a problem with christianism ? @charliemonson You are a disgrace to the founding principles of your country @Lapid1 @iyad_elbaghdadi @flinx15 Yes it's a crime. But when it's done like this it's an act of terror. Again, what's your point? @aamer045 @OllieFunnell Why do Muslims want 2 live in dissolute places like France/UK/USA/Canada? Please explain. @imgelem @Chrisrdb @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham not that many. &amp; not that innocent. &amp; YES, I condemned! but not for fact they were musl @imgelem @Chrisrdb @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham I condemn not just USA, any gov's recklessness in being involved in killing innocent. @imgelem @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham they should have shouted #allahdoesnotexist @AmirModabbernia Your PROPHET himself was a monster you cretin! @MelissaTweets @ericdondero @iyad_elbaghdadi @imgelem @Chrisrdb @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham but that ideology that you defend so BLINDLY is just disgusting. @AmirModabbernia It isnt just a few people: Islamic nations still execute for blasphemy etc. @MelissaTweets @ericdondero @iyad_elbaghdadi @Budman16 Yeah, and entire countries which execute for blasphemy. @AmirModabbernia @MelissaTweets @ericdondero @iyad_elbaghdadi @Budman16 Islam is Muhammad, and Muhammad is a CUNT. @AmirModabbernia @MelissaTweets @ericdondero @iyad_elbaghdadi @jpnoelhk @OllieFunnell I don't live in West ask any Muslim out there. There are alot ofnur creed converted too ask them @imgelem @Chrisrdb @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham that ideology, that religion, requiring you to murder, allowing you theft and rape.. @imgelem @Chrisrdb @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham for mare fact that you are muslim, and the other is not, is disgusting. @MullinsDaRapper Why #isis still consider themselves religious? Read here: http://t.co/toUvG15Vae @jpnoelhk @OllieFunnell yeah police officers innocents cartoonist did provoke and disrespected religion responsible for their acts @IslamRevisited3 I've read the quran. It is not the word of God, it is a hate document. Fuck Islam with a million pig penises, FUCK IT!!! @aamer045 @jpnoelhk @OllieFunnell So familyguy made fun or jesus and his 'magic' we should start killing them over a funny cartoon 😂? @imgelem @Chrisrdb @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham your ideology is just too sick.. @natalieski2 @jpnoelhk @OllieFunnell since they b were not family guys not applicable in above clause @imgelem @Chrisrdb @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham Murat, you are allowed to steal from non muslim. You will still go to heaven. @imgelem @Chrisrdb @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham Murat, you are allowed and rewarded for killing non Muslim. You'll go to heaven for it @aamer045 @jpnoelhk @OllieFunnell Religion is an absolute waste or time, theres no such thing as any god 😂 @MullinsDaRapper @MelissaTweets @iyad_elbaghdadi  ""My prophet?"". You have no idea what u r talking about. but nice try to show your bigotry @imgelem @Chrisrdb @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham Murat it's ok for you to rape non Muslim. You are allowed. @vokayaqul You are rehearsing Judaism's tenets, not Islam. You seemed to ignorant about topic @Chrisrdb @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham @aamer045 Its like a cartoon making fun of scottish people and me going down killing them in the name of william wallace 😂😂 Utterly stupid @natalieski2 @jpnoelhk @OllieFunnell might be for u but this belief does not give u right to disrespect it for those who believe in it @MullinsDaRapper @MelissaTweets @iyad_elbaghdadi And your type of ignorance is no different from Jihadist types. two sides of the same coin @MullinsDaRapper @MelissaTweets @iyad_elbaghdadi AND u r confusing Islamists with Muslims. Now go try to learn some facts. @aamer045 @jpnoelhk @OllieFunnell So im not aloud to disrespect a bunch of crazy people who murdered people doing a funny job 😂 @imgelem @Chrisrdb @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham Saudi cleric confirms your prophet was phedophile &amp;rapist. but you'd still kill for him @imgelem @Chrisrdb @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham http://t.co/Sew5T4Frdg @imgelem @Chrisrdb @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham which Judaism tenets do I rehearse? that was Saudi assertion.. @Chrisrdb @imgelem @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham Then I wonder when extreme Jews or Christians are gonna attack. Hmmm. #never? @imgelem @Chrisrdb @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham Murat you had no choice to be Muslim. you were told to be one. @imgelem @Chrisrdb @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham you are forced to be one. @imgelem @Chrisrdb @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham you are victim. &amp; u are stuck in there. coz deep down u still think u have no choice. @campaignbear and muslims a disgrace of humanity??? @ericdondero @iyad_elbaghdadi @MelissaTweets You can't accuse all Muslims of being terrorists. @MarcuMalmb @iyad_elbaghdadi @flinx15 you can't say kill people it's offensive, it's not enough, you can't compare this act to a cartoon. @aamer045 @Graham_Booth @iyad_elbaghdadi But you can't kill people for publishing a cartoon. Get over it. A delightful tweet to a Muslim who CONDEMNS the #CharlieHebdo attacks. RT “@charliemonson: @iyad_elbaghdadi  fuck u fucking muslim” @aamer045 @Graham_Booth @iyad_elbaghdadi Your idea of expression is a bit worse! @Lapid1 @iyad_elbaghdadi @flinx15 Serious problem with your reading? I don't compare, neither does  he! He's telling us that it's wrong! @MetalOllie Unfortunately incidents like this not only result in senseless slaughter, but also spark sweeping anti-religious sentiment. @charliemonson You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Do you actually know any Muslims? @MetalOllie There are extremes on both sides &amp; both are extremely harmful. Don't understand why it's so hard to take a logical view :/ @gemrock786 @aamer045 @iyad_elbaghdadi I never said a Muslim name made you a Muslim? 😂😂 @AmirModabbernia @MullinsDaRapper @MelissaTweets @iyad_elbaghdadi  Are you defending these animals? Why is Islam overflowing with murderers? @MetalOllie Aka, condemning violence in the strongest terms, wherever its source, but not blaming billions of innocent people of faith. @drwhofan_194 Indeed. I'm as vocal on religion as any ardent atheist, but if people can't distinguish between Muslim and Islamic terrorist.. @aamer045 @OllieFunnell You do have a point there. @drwhofan_194 ..nutcases who'd oppress their own people to stuff their ideology down everyone's throats, they need a reality check. @AmirModabbernia So, opposing an irrational death cult is as bad as the death cult it opposes? Eat shit and die. @MelissaTweets @Lapid1 @Criminimed @lbonoli @iyad_elbaghdadi @flinx15 Some folks can't tell unequivocal condemnation. @OllieFunnell @gemrock786 @iyad_elbaghdadi yes u never said that. Name does not make u Muslim or Christian ur faith does @GailRice12 @MullinsDaRapper @MelissaTweets @iyad_elbaghdadi Nobody is animal here. And I am defending innocent people not these terrorists @aamer045 @gemrock786 @iyad_elbaghdadi it doesn't, I'm atheist, but I wouldn't mock religion, it's just basic respect, disgusting.. @AmirModabbernia Islam is bigotry. By the way, you are an insufferable cunt who fully deserves Sharia. @MelissaTweets @iyad_elbaghdadi @OllieFunnell @gemrock786 @iyad_elbaghdadi if ubr arthiest i dont mock u either.there is respect and no thing disgusting @AmirModabbernia Name all the people I've killed in the name of my 'bigotry' then, scumbag. @MelissaTweets @iyad_elbaghdadi @AmirModabbernia lol ""Islamist"" is a meaningless term, nothing but a rhetorical bluster! I hope cancer eats your bones.@MelissaTweets @AmirModabbernia Here's a FACT: the Quran says the sun orbits earth. Here's another: it doesn't!! @MelissaTweets @iyad_elbaghdadi @imgelem @MahathirAlHadi @thunderdriver @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham if you are Muslim, it makes you shout allah u akbar.. @AmirModabbernia &lt; what a cunt, I can only hope and pray that a painful cancerous death awaits him. @MelissaTweets @iyad_elbaghdadi @MetalOllie @charliemonson @iyad_elbaghdadi this shows how rerated he is. Ignorance is a disease. @aamer045 @gemrock786 @iyad_elbaghdadi I mean mocking religion is disgusting.. But killing people in the name of religion is worse.. @OllieFunnell @gemrock786 @iyad_elbaghdadi I do agree but we must make sure no provoking 2 heat up amd get worse in killing s @Graham_Booth @iyad_elbaghdadi @piersmorgan all terrorists are Muslim? IRA? ETA? Bader meinhoff?  Well youLearn something every day. @fannybawsdougal @iyad_elbaghdadi IRA and ETA laid down arms long ago.

The practitioners of your ""religion"" are animals. @GailRice12 @MullinsDaRapper @MelissaTweets @iyad_elbaghdadi No they simply slaughter. Does that make terrorism no terrorism? @AmirModabbernia @MullinsDaRapper @MelissaTweets @iyad_elbaghdadi  Do you, personally, feel people should be killed for leaving Islam? @AmirModabbernia @MullinsDaRapper @MelissaTweets @iyad_elbaghdadi  Because a third of your fellows do. @GailRice12 @MullinsDaRapper @MelissaTweets @iyad_elbaghdadi evidence? @GailRice12 @MullinsDaRapper @MelissaTweets @iyad_elbaghdadi dude, ask a Muslim @GailRice12 @MullinsDaRapper @MelissaTweets @iyad_elbaghdadi I am not one @AmirModabbernia In that cqse you are a pseudo-liberal appeaser of Islam, which is worse. @GailRice12 @MelissaTweets @iyad_elbaghdadi @MullinsDaRapper @AmirModabbernia @MelissaTweets @iyad_elbaghdadi  Amir, are you a supporter of genital mutilation? Child rape? @aumd9 @aamer045 @iyad_elbaghdadi Go back to ur old school and kick your English teacher's ass. They failed you horribly. @kevinhaast @imgelem @iyad_elbaghdadi @erinmcunningham Que certains fous utilisent l'Islam... Que peuvent y faire les musulmans pacifistes? @ericdondero @iyad_elbaghdadi @melissatweets how eloquently put! Your Mother would be proud of you. @Graham_Booth @iyad_elbaghdadi ira laid weapons down? Officially maybe. They both still exist though. @Graham_Booth @iyad_elbaghdadi wanksock? From Newcastle you Boro wannabe tosser @Say10Simon @aamer045 @iyad_elbaghdadi 😂😂😂 @imgelem @thunderdriver @iyad_elbaghdadi What difference does it make? They obviously felt what they did was making a religious statement. @fannybawsdougal  Boro ?? hahaha you really are a cretin aren't you and YES you are a wank sock you idiotic Geordie arsehole @fannybawsdougal @iyad_elbaghdadi yes they exist but my point was EVERY terrorist outrage carried out today is perpetrated by Muslims @Graham_Booth @iyad_elbaghdadi @piersmorgan you never said TODAY. Tool. @Lapid1 @MarcuMalmb @iyad_elbaghdadi @flinx15 he's saying it's wrong. They killed because of an offensive cartoon. He said kill is worse. @Muslimusk People who are so afraid of a pen that they have to kill, deserve the contempt of all civilized humanity @iyad_elbaghdadi @Graham_Booth Maybe if the west stopped trying to change the countries in the M.E the people wouldn't try and ""change"" this country @Graham_Booth @iyad_elbaghdadi @piersmorgan The terrorist Anders Breivik killed 78 people in Norway. Not a Muslim. Keep to facts please. @Bjarcore @iyad_elbaghdadi @piersmorgan he killed to raise a point about Muslims in Norway read his court statement you imbecile @Hxmzaaaaaaaa maybe the Middle East should leave the 6th century and join the rest if the world in the 21st century and we will @Graham_Booth double standards galore.

Thank You for those words @ericdondero The level of ignorance, bigotry &amp; (yes) poor English reading comprehension in these comments is staggering.  @iyad_elbaghdadi @MarcuMalmb @charliemonson @iyad_elbaghdadi @NickKristof clearly a lot! @campaignbear @charliemonson there is ur answer. Keyboard warrior @julia_goo_lia @charliemonson Indeed! Where did he go? @Graham_Booth @Bjarcore @iyad_elbaghdadi @piersmorgan so he was a Christian terrorist? Imagine that! @campaignbear @charliemonson he ran like a bitch from ur question I would guess ! @Graham_Booth @iyad_elbaghdadi @piersmorgan does that make him a non-terrorist? @julia_goo_lia @Bjarcore @iyad_elbaghdadi @piersmorgan 1 Christian terrorist V how many Muslim you do the maths you cretinous wank stain @Graham_Booth @julia_goo_lia @iyad_elbaghdadi @piersmorgan love the insults. Thank you for the enlightened words. @Graham_Booth @julia_goo_lia @iyad_elbaghdadi @piersmorgan you said all terrorists were Muslim. I corrected you with facts. @Graham_Booth @Bjarcore @iyad_elbaghdadi keep going its good to have tweets to report @Graham_Booth @Bjarcore @iyad_elbaghdadi @piersmorgan go write an opera 😂😂 gold @julia_goo_lia go fuck yourself you hideous tramp @ericdondero @AwwalJakada this is the level of the argument. 12 people die and you're going with fat comments and pork chops. Wow. @ericdondero 25 Deadliest Mass Shootings in U.S. History Fast Facts http://t.co/XO0cjudDzp via @cnnbrk @cnnireport @vokayaqul there's nothing about 15 y.o girls getting married in Qur'an,this is all wrong,they like to come up with new rules from their own @G__Chii hope so. Coz its just too sad that Muslims apply rules meant for that age &amp; that region on themselves, everyone around &amp; this age.. @G__Chii rules on whats wrong and right, how to wash ass and what food to avoid.. maybe it was good for survival of that nation at that time @G__Chii what today's muslim say is that they have a duty to force everyone else in the world to do the same. to have same imaginary friend. @G__Chii Muslims' duty is to make everyone in the world to eat same food and wash ass in that same particular way. or else.. @G__Chii ""moderate"" Muslims are trying to re-write Quran. Bring different meanings to verses. you've tried that - different schools of islam @G__Chii ended up in bloodshed.. and now this.. Violence. Root: beliefs.. @vokayaqul being muslim and a saudi myself i hear all kinds of new rules that uneducated people set as if it was something that god said @G__Chii Islamization is there. :( but I strongly believe that there will be no religion in 100-200 years from now. don't you agree? @G__Chii yeah.. true. ppl always try to highjack idea.. @vokayaqul people who have strong beliefs will stick to their beliefs and the other way around , you really never know @vokayaqul i learnt that i should ignore  people and only listen to whatgod say not what they say bc frankly you can't trust people nowadays @vokayaqul yes exactly , where i live people who have no life that's how they get off , by making up new rules and force you to follow it @g__chii makes sense @julia_goo_lia Clearly! Btw, how's Australia copping with your latest tragedy, the Cafe hostage situation? Like putting gas on a fire now? @MarcuMalmb had memorials and lots of media coverage but moved on quickly.

*runs out of exclamation marks* @WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell Some people also love not being murdered for satirising ideas which blatantly need to be satirised, but hey ho. .@JoeMiles94 @mrjohnofarrell I wasn't contesting that. It was the reference to political correctness I was questioning. @mrjohnofarrell as a white person I feel deeply offended by this cartoon! @WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell Nothing's wrong with being PC at all, but not being so shouldn't expose you to the risk of terrorist attack @WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell Being politically correct is to pretend living in a world that doesn't http://t.co/PccgrfM0BE should focus on RL? .@RobJHarkavy @mrjohnofarrell I don't think the terrorists were concerned about 'political correctness'. Equating the two is, er, snide. @mrjohnofarrell @jeremydrysdale Why is it so white? Seems racist. .@JanneKro @mrjohnofarrell What, we shouldn't try to oppose racism and sexism because racism and sexism exist, you mean?! @WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell Well, they appear to have been concerned about being insulted. I take your point, however. @WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell Criticising religion is often seen as unPC, the term is ambiguous. I agree with avoiding racism in satire though. @Jensemens @mrjohnofarrell There's that word again ""offended"" again, do you use it to describe everything? @RobJHarkavy @WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell There's everything wrong with being PC, it's brainwashing of the worst kind. @WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell the problem is you can be proud of who you are unless you're a straight white man @Jensemens @mrjohnofarrell You disgust me. How can this be your priority when people are dying over a cartoon! #vile @WadjaKnow @JoeMiles94 @mrjohnofarrell PC as a smear is how the Right attacks human rights &amp; equality. Similar to #shriekingfeminist. Robert Mankoff, The New Yorker, septembre 2012 #CharlieHebdo http://t.co/iCtiBQWYzh via @mrjohnofarrell .@tristram32 @RobJHarkavy @mrjohnofarrell 'Brainwashing' is a actually a bit of a myth.

#CharlieHebdo http://t.co/ukLiUMXPwt” @WadjaKnow @RobJHarkavy @mrjohnofarrell Then I stand with George Orwell on that then. @WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell Highlighting issues in society with satire is not racism, it's talking about it. Unlike pol. cor. that does nada. .@coyelt @mrjohnofarrell Why on earth would you feel the need to be 'proud' to be a man and white?! That's an accident of birth. @WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell be proud of who you are .@JanneKro @mrjohnofarrell Nope, you've lost me there I'm afraid. @GillFTaylor @Jensemens @mrjohnofarrell Right, how can the survival of your people by your priority?! You monster! .@coyelt I am proud of who I am, as an individual, in some ways. I'm not taking credit or blame for accidents of birth, however. .@tristram32 Don't think Orwell ever used the term 'brainwashing'. A lot of what he says about language and power in 1984 is dodgy. @GillFTaylor @mrjohnofarrell sorry you don't seem to get the point of @mrjohnfarrell ' cartoon @WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell I drew you a picture. #politically correct text together with #satire. #religion http://t.co/XfYeJStEoi .@JanneKro @mrjohnofarrell Er, nice. Are you opposed to religious freedom then? @WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell I'm sorry if you still don't get it. :( .@coyelt Can you explain to me why you're proud to be a) white and b) a man? @quintal232 @GillFTaylor @mrjohnofarrell you misunderstand me, this terrible murder appearantly happened because people can't face satire. @WadjaKnow can you explain why I shouldn't be? @tristram32 @mrjohnofarrell sorry I don't get your point or maybe you don't get the point I was trying to make @quintal232 @GillFTaylor @Jensemens @mrjohnofarrell Jens. Satire is truly dead. Did they even look at the cartoon. @ryanseanie @quintal232 @GillFTaylor @mrjohnofarrell probably they didn't but hopefully satire is not dead @quintal232 @GillFTaylor @mrjohnofarrell I hope you see my earlier posting about @jesuischarlie in a different light as what it was: satire @WadjaKnow So ""newspeak"" is dodgy? @tristram32 I think the notion that thoughts can be made unthinkable by modifying language is lacking in credibility @coyelt No, the onus is on you to explain why you hold a certain view, not on me to explain why I don't. @WadjaKnow Then you must be living in a cupboard, hear no evil, see no evil, but speaking utter horseshit. @tristram32 Oh i'm sorry I thought you were capable of an adult discussion, my bad. @WadjaKnow there's no onus on me. You 'oppose' sexism/racism yet claim my gender/ethnicity is an accident?
Double Standards. @WadjaKnow Tried that, you appear to be impervious. @coyelt Everyone's gender and ethnicity is an accident. Did you decide to be a white man? .@coyelt You say that you're proud to a white man. I asked you why. That's a reasonable question. @WadjaKnow why is that an accident? @WadjaKnow I can ejaculate &amp; tan (simultaneously if I wish) .@coyelt That is genuinely funny, nice one. But it suggests you're not really serious about being proud of being white and being a man. @Jensemens @mrjohnofarrell @jesuischarlie Yes I was replying to @GillFTaylor. Satire appreciated. @Jensemens @quintal232 @mrjohnofarrell My Mistake and sincere apologies Jens @quintal232 @Jensemens @mrjohnofarrell Not sure I understand the question? @GillFTaylor @quintal232 @mrjohnofarrell I appreciate your apology it's sometimes hard to recognize satire ;) @Jensemens @quintal232 @mrjohnofarrell touché ;) @WadjaKnow @coyelt @mrjohnofarrell So yer pa accidentally fell over on yer ma and U sprog out? @WadjaKnow @JoeMiles94 @mrjohnofarrell

They have eyes but do not see and ears but do not hear, and some have been @PittWitchHunt @fuller_derek @GLove39 turned over to a reprobated mind where they will embrace a lie before they believe the truth @PittWitchHunt @fuller_derek @GLove39 been that way since they rewrote the bible with King Jqmes of England @PittWitchHunt @LarryWoolfolk - ...or religion-like deceptions, like 'The Word of the Prophet Ailes'. #Foxocracy @fuller_derek @GLove39 @PittWitchHunt @LarryWoolfolk @fuller_derek @GLove39 Television is best at controlling the masses. @jennyfrky @LarryWoolfolk @fuller_derek @GLove39 Of course TV in such cases clearly follows the marching orders of the ""hands that feed it"" @PittWitchHunt @jennyfrky @fuller_derek @GLove39 it is a corporation and its worker or those that depend on it for their existence report @PittWitchHunt @jennyfrky @fuller_derek @GLove39 what they tell them especially #Fox no news yea.. @LarryWoolfolk @PittWitchHunt @jennyfrky @GLove39 http://t.co/C0GCYXQor0 @fuller_derek @LarryWoolfolk Fox is out of control #STUPID

HE knows how to deal with these savages. @BradThor but will France actually do something about their massive problem simmering in its ghettos ?  More to come until they act @BradThor killing people avenges no one's honor. Those with honor can withstand any offense by ignoring it and leading by example. @BradThor @ad5red it's not religion or offending belief its barbaric, inhuman acts of terrorism. Thoughts with the families @BradThor please don't blame all muslims. I'm a muslim and my prayers are going to Paris right now. Not all of us are like those bastards. @BradThor   Until they kick their butts out of their country this will keep happening. @BradThor Muslims endearing themselves to the world again. @Ratillathehun @BradThor There's an anti-islamic wave on the horizon. When it breaks, I don't want to hear any whining from these freaks. @Maskati16 @BradThor sorry yousif. You are right not all Muslims are the same. We are all in it together. Wish we could stop the madness @oldhickory49 @BradThor They only understand VIOLENCE. and they are cowards. @krobmeh @BradThor I don't blame you for thinking all muslims are the same, since many attacks have happened but most of us do NOT encourage @krobmeh @BradThor these attacks, these people who do this have lost their humanity. @BradThor @jhinderaker It should result in millions more cartoons created. @Maskati16 Not blaming all Muslims.  I am blaming those Muslims who killed 12+ people in Paris today. @BradThor thanks for clearing it out. Prayers go to the families of the 12 victims. #ParisShooting @Maskati16 @BradThor 
repent from worshipping satan
repent and turn to the Lord Jesus Christ @OCDwiththetruth worshipping Satan? I think you've got it wrong, or at least i hope so. Please don't tell me how to live my life. @Maskati16
you can live whatever life you want
but if you try to save your life, you will lose it, but if you lose it, you will save it @OCDwiththetruth get lost plz. @Maskati16
its you who is lost @OCDwiththetruth ok @Maskati16 @krobmeh @BradThor but what do you do to STOP this? @Bob20J @Maskati16 @krobmeh Only the members of the Muslim faith  can stop it.

This will up (cont) @Bob20J @Maskati16 @krobmeh the pressure on Muslim nations to enact serious, visible reforms, shut radical mosques, etc. @BradThor @Bob20J @Maskati16 yes sir. I wouldn't put it all on the Muslim faith but these countries that claim to be peaceful need to help @BradThor @Bob20J @Maskati16 us in eliminating these radicals. I think it's going to take everyone to say that's enough @oldhickory49 @BradThor Just like liberal tolerance. They love you... as long as you agree with everything they say. @brianandzane @BradThor There's nothing more viciously intolerant than a pony-tailed professor. @BradThor @Maskati16 @krobmeh I'm thinking that if the muslims don't provide the pressure non muslims will be applying pressure on triggers @oldhickory49 @BradThor Who's bald down the middle. The middle age mullet lol @krobmeh @BradThor @Maskati16 maybe not on all muslims just the ones that read the quran @BradThor Does that include non-muslims?

There is No God!
Wake up. @LibyaLiberty @goldietaylor That only makes sense to people that have sense. @MevlutTatliyer that's a little juvenile and an appropriate response would be ""how do you know"". But there is a context to her and you + @MevlutTatliyer +don't seem to get it. But that's fine. @LibyaLiberty Christians look at this Islamic god and say, ""How weak that he can't withstand satire"" @LibyaLiberty @mahobili insult the consituation and there is death penalty articale 6 ,Propht pbhm  is greater then your made consituation Exactly. She is a juvenile and trying to free herself from indictment against her identity which is under construction. @Seggitorial I am not sure. I just presume, think. My clue is the as a Muslim part. Why did she highlight that? Think. @Seggitorial @MevlutTatliyer she highlighted it because she lives in America where there is a narrative saying that Muslims should apologise for attacks @MevlutTatliyer + and she highlighted it to say she rejected it. Exactly. That is my point. Two Muslim identities. One is apologetic, mild, no threat. The others terrorists that she just made @Seggitorial @MevlutTatliyer no not really. Muslims dont have to say anything about this attack. Condemning it ""as a Muslim"" undermines Islam perception further! @Seggitorial @MevlutTatliyer that was her point. She wasn't condemning it as a Muslim or apologising for it or whatever. @MevlutTatliyer and to be fair I think murderous acts being perpetrated in name of (insert religion) do most to undermine (insert religion) Why did not you condemn it as a Christian, or as a human, or as a male, or as a brown eyed, or liberal, or rightist? @Seggitorial Then just think. Who can be behind these things? Muslims? You can insert it. Dont worry. We know. @Seggitorial @MevlutTatliyer if a murderous attack was perpetrated by people in the name of Scottish independence (let's say) then I may feel obligated + @MevlutTatliyer to condemn it as a human and make the same point about not having to condemn it as a support of an independent Scotland @MevlutTatliyer I don't think you know as much as you claim. At the present time, the evidence seems to point to lunatics claiming to do + Obligated? Then some can think that we can use this logic? What happened in 9/11?? @Seggitorial @MevlutTatliyer + this in name of Islam. If I were a Muslim this would probably bother me (see my Scottish independence example) What bothers me is the Puppet holder. Who did Danıştay attack im Turkey? Think that too. @Seggitorial @MevlutTatliyer yes obligated. If people were killing others in the name of something I believed in (independence) then rightly or wrongly+ @MevlutTatliyer I would feel the need to defend my belief from what was tainting it. @MevlutTatliyer Occam's razor. Conspiracy theories are intellectually lazy I am disgusted with all these terrorism stuff. Who did this is the sole responsible. Not any muslim! @Seggitorial @MevlutTatliyer of course, you are 100% right. But you also have to be concerned that something you believe in is getting a bad PR Occam's razor is just a rule of thumb. Reality can have multiple facets. I am not lazy to look beyond the seeming. @Seggitorial A bad PR? I dont care what others think. Reality is superior to PR. @Seggitorial @MevlutTatliyer and it's a very useful rule of thumb at that. reality can have multiple facets but that does not take away from my point. @MevlutTatliyer that is a very 'Turkish' response, if you pardon the generalization. The Cyprus case is a great example as to why PR&gt;reality Are you being racist? I can label it as Mevlutish. That's my point. I am not Representative of Turkness or maleness. @Seggitorial @BrianFooli @LibyaLiberty Cuz the Western people always demand Muslims to apologise for something we didn't commit @LibyaLiberty well said, really, to the point!! @Omzyyyy_ @LibyaLiberty it's madness. Those guys were warned too and still did it. @TheyluvSanye @SUNNY291056 @LibyaLiberty I getcha Irony:Terrorists have done for #CharliHebdo what their prophet cartoons could never have done:gain the solidarity of millions of Muslims. @LibyaLiberty thank you. Insult to the Prophet? I can think of no greater insult to God than to have the temerity to end the life of His creation via @LibyaLiberty @LibyaLiberty @Dr_mz13 These attacks against civilians also incur a wrath of vengeance unfortunately against Muslims, most being innocents. @fayazbutt @LibyaLiberty @mahobili ""made constitution"" Yes. Made by people. Just like religion, but w/o absurd claims of gods &amp; ""prophets"". @LibyaLiberty @mehdirhasan Why are you thinking about gods &amp; ""prophets"" *at all* in the 21st Century?!

I do know shit @thefirstcondor @MuslimIQ @abgutman it's a peaceful religion, some of the people practicing it are simply not @ddltobias @MuslimIQ @abgutman  oh I have read many parts of it.....not all, as I'm not good with fiction.

I have shown you hat.. http://t.co/SDUCsFQT5P @thefirstcondor God was telling Muhammad that he is with the muslims, strengthening them and putting faith in their hearts @thefirstcondor and on the contrary putting fear in nonbelievers' hearts and he encouraged them to fight them because they were torturing- @thefirstcondor -Muslims in Quraish and everywhere they encountered them, so this has nothing to do for muslims fighting each other @Maryam_Khaled   There's an elephant in the room.....the Q has several versions     Only #atheism doesn't kill ppl. http://t.co/tLlTIlIDfm @thefirstcondor and btw a muslim killing another muslim is considered he Fifth Greater sin in Islam so you can NEver say that it's written @thefirstcondor and btw this is an actual verse in quran http://t.co/6ROu5DTeaU @thefirstcondor you are totally free for your choices :) ,i was just making it clear that there was a misunderstanding. @Maryam_Khaled there are going to be an awful lot of Muslims in hell, wouldn't you agree? @thefirstcondor i totallyy agree, what these people do is inhumane and totaly unreligious it has nothing to do with islam trust me @thefirstcondor just one more thing, read more and open your mind to all ideas, really. #payng more attention does not kill :) @Maryam_Khaled oh I read.........lots of books for me.....I know my roots and a tribe of flat earth believers is not it.

Are you trying to stop the teachers. @Naz1o @tinkizee @abgutman The first victim in the #CharlieHebdo attack was a police officer guarding the building. His name?

Feel free to browse my timeline and find something before you talk such crap @xahjaved @MaajidNawaz don't come at me with you cut &amp; paste edginess or I'm going to have to swear at you on twitter. I apologised for nowt @AliShahQalandar take your own advice. @richard_landes @MaajidNawaz @AliShahQalandar No speculation. They shouted ""alluhah akbar"".

@AAyoko @MaajidNawaz @Damocles247 @AAyoko @MaajidNawaz you lot seem to think repeating the same thing makes you cleverer. They also spoke French. And? @AliShahQalandar And they were muslim! And?
@AAyoko @MaajidNawaz @Damocles247 @AAyoko @MaajidNawaz from where? Which org? Who trained them? Were there 2 or 3? Those rifles are from where?  Know all that? @Damocles247 nah they're Ifá worshipping pagans man @AliShahQalandar @MaajidNawaz @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz when Utoya Island happened YOU were busy telling everyone  it was definitely ""western civilisation""? Hypocrit. @AAyoko @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz allegedly one of the Policemen confronting them was also Muslim. What does that do for your narrative? @AliShahQalandar Muslims kill everyone for their cause. ISIS also kills muslims. That's what Allah commanded.
@AAyoko @MaajidNawaz @AliShahQalandar ever heard of Boko Haram? They're Muslims who kill Muslims @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz @Damocles247 @AAyoko you're  obviously  more illiterate  than I thought. @MaajidNawaz got to love these folk @AAyoko @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz ever been to Lagos. I have. @AAyoko @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz what about the insurgents in the delta? @AAyoko @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz considering the state of Chibok, Boko Haram have many factors to them. @AliShahQalandar What about Mohammed? He killed muslims for apostacy and called moderate muslims hypocrites.
@AAyoko @MaajidNawaz @AAyoko @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz I doubt you have the time to consider the state of post Biafran Nigeria. @Damocles247 @AAyoko @MaajidNawaz which version of the seera is that in? Are you repeating the stuff off Answering Islam? @AliShahQalandar when rightwing Pegida marched, still called them Germans. Why so hard to say jihadis are Muslim @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz @AliShahQalandar goat I'm Nigerian @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz @AliShahQalandar goat I'm in Lagos. Tell me what I don't know @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz @AliShahQalandar I can tell you don't understand what antitheism is, it's the statement that even if god exists then it's cruel &amp; sadistic @AliShahQalandar what has the deltan militants got to do with boko haram. Diverging ehh? @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz @AAyoko @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz yeah.. well I used to chill on Ikoyi. Aand you son should  pay more attention on class @AliShahQalandar what pray tell? I'm listening @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz @AliShahQalandar I grew up in Ikoyi. Work in Ikoyi. So what? @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz @AAyoko @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz chibok and Port Harcout have serious issues which feed insurgencies. You know that. Don't act the big Oga. @AliShahQalandar identity politics &amp; narrative was set by Islamists, they think death is fine for satire &amp; depiction of muhammad @AliShahQalandar tell me more about my country o.. You Nigerian? Lebanese? Arab? Stayed anywhere apart from lag? @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz @Anas_Abbas1 @MaajidNawaz 
There have already been discussions on twitter about this. The general consensus is that racism is to blame. @AAyoko @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz  that Moorhouse is nice hotel. Over priced though. @AliShahQalandar insurgencies fueled by different undertones. Big difference @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz @AliShahQalandar so? @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz @soulesssniper you say ""they"" as if it's one set of dudes in bond lair somewhere. @AAyoko @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz lol.. sure as if Boko weren't an outspurt of the dire corruption &amp; resource hoarding. Illiterate. @AAyoko @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz you seem to have bought knowledge from the traffic jam book sellers. Go away dude. @AliShahQalandar no, I say they as Islamists who must force others to follow their religion or get will kill, see #peshwarattack @AliShahQalandar hahaha answer my question. Have you been anywhere in Nigeria apart from ikoyi? Ignorant buffon @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz @AliShahQalandar lol answer my question. Where else in Nigeria have you been to? Know any Nigerian? Hmm? @Damocles247 @MaajidNawaz @soulesssniper but they aren't  one set of blokes in a room. Are they? Speaking as someone  who has friens targeted  by that attack @AliShahQalandar no, they are fascists, fascists who must impose religion on others, killing to enforce their religious edicts is a symptom @soulesssniper facism is a modern phenomena though as is the revisionism of some of these groups @AliShahQalandar modern?! Did you forget the dark ages? @soulesssniper they are a modern phenomenon. Part of the reaction to modernity. @soulesssniper its a revisionist movement to some extent.  Began late 19th and early 2pth century @AliShahQalandar have you heard of the ridda wars? @soulesssniper buddy. Don't  educate me on history  when you are unaware  of the epistemology of current movements @AliShahQalandar fascism is nothing new, fascists existed throughout history, religion is the best tool @soulesssniper fascism is early 20th c political  movement @AliShahQalandar I wouldn't attempt to educate anyone who thinks fascism is a new thing or ignores ridda wars as evidence @soulesssniper now you're  just using hyperbole &amp; rhetoric @soulesssniper obviously  becuase its wrong. Fascism is a specific term for a early 20th century  movement. Any other use is just rhetoric",non-rumours
Not in our name – Muslims respond in revulsion to #CharlieHebdo shooting.  http://t.co/KFfhprXNFb,"@FraserNelson Good. Now let's hear millions of Muslims say the same thing. Here, in Britain. And in France.  Oh, hang on a min... @FraserNelson actions speak louder than words. @FraserNelson thank you @FraserNelson glad you published that hun. Too often Muslims I know get unfairly accused of not speaking out. They are, but voices not heard @FraserNelson Best thing Muslims can do is support for liberal values by actively proclaiming the right of Charlie Hebdo to publish cartoons @FraserNelson @Busty1956 Absolutely &amp; Loudly RT @FraserNelson: Not in our name – Muslims respond in revulsion to #CharlieHebdo shooting.  http://t.co/5HUQKvyJfE @FraserNelson Any word from the Immans condemning the attack yet? No thought not. .@UrsulineKid This is a stupid comment. Muslims do condemn these attacks. You don't have to look hard either. @FraserNelson @tomhagen_ @FraserNelson Not seeing or hearing it, I'm afraid. I dearly wish to. I see no marchers shouting 'not in our name', for example. .@UrsulineKid @FraserNelson Why do you expect them to march? Iraq/Gaza etc is political activism for the British govts attn. No need here. @tomhagen_ @FraserNelson just to replicate what the lefties in Britain did in defence of Islamic communities in Iraq, say? Would be a start. @UrsulineKid @FraserNelson eg Peshawar Attack. British Muslims condemned that. No protest reqd; British govt had no influence or involvement @tomhagen_ @FraserNelson Indeed, and rightly so. But it was on 'their' soil. Let's see how they react in France this evening. @UrsulineKid @FraserNelson What are you referring to? I already addressed the point of the Iraq/Gaza protests which Muslims took part in. @tomhagen_ @UrsulineKid @FraserNelson not here in USA! Our president says ISIL is not Islamic! It is in their name for the Love of God! @patfo49 @UrsulineKid @FraserNelson If i set up Christian State, it won't, by default, make my actions consistent with Christian beliefs. @FraserNelson @SayeedaWarsi Condemnation easy, insufficient. Explanation? Prevention? @FraserNelson @heather_venter   But the leaders of the muslim community are obvious by their absence....... as usual.... @patfo49 @UrsulineKid @FraserNelson That's not the point. Re-read my comment. YES @BaronessDeech , BECAUSE ISLAMISTS ONLY DO WHAT NORMAL MUSLIMS TELL THEM TO DO, RIGHT?...  @FraserNelson @SayeedaWarsi @tomhagen_ @UrsulineKid @FraserNelson sadly tom the majority don't seem to be rushing to condemn .@ThehatmThehat @UrsulineKid @FraserNelson Are you expecting a joint press release from 1.6bn people? @ThehatmThehat twat! @tomhagen_ @UrsulineKid @FraserNelson @Rolo_Tamasi Right in there with a right hook.

In the West, no one is forced to practice any religion. @OliGarner1 @FraserNelson Your second point doesn't relate to you openly suggesting how it is 'acceptable' to mock all religions @OliGarner1 @FraserNelson Is you want to talk about the West, we're unable to mock ppls skin colour openly as its classed offensive @OliGarner1 @FraserNelson So we can't cause offence to ones skin but can on their personal beliefs in the name of free speech.  Hell no @LancashireNyla @OliGarner1 @FraserNelson Unlike religion, you are somewhat forced to practice your own skin colour . . . @JamesMcLachlan7 @OliGarner1 @FraserNelson Analogy is still the same. You wouldn't dare to go up to a dark skinned person and call him.. @JamesMcLachlan7 @OliGarner1 @FraserNelson black n****r so and so and proclaim its your right of speech @JamesMcLachlan7 @OliGarner1 @FraserNelson But can mock their personal belief via different means @LancashireNyla @OliGarner1 @FraserNelson It's perfectly acceptable to mock voluntarily accepted extremist ideology. Essential, actually. @LancashireNyla @OliGarner1 @FraserNelson Mocking the colour of someone's skin is an affront to arbitrary genetic differences. @JamesMcLachlan7 @OliGarner1 @FraserNelson You'v jus created tht ideology and directing it 2 Islam as whole forgetting th point in discusion @JamesMcLachlan7 @OliGarner1 @FraserNelson Mockery of any ones religion is NOT acceprable.

Common-Sense is NOT Censorship.  #CharlieHebdo @TheAuracl3 @wikileaks it said ""republish"" @wikileaks @mrb218 Which furthers my point. The cartoons are very much accessible. Even now.

Did you want it to change? @PoliceStateAlba Take a look at their recent statements on their website. Of course, I encourage and support such change .@PeterTatchell Tell Mama website is part of the problem. The feedback page still features former indulged 'pal' Mo Ansar. No change there. .@PeterTatchell Do you think their 'Islamophobia' led strategy was misguided? Divisive? Did you ask for a new approach? It hasn't worked. @PoliceStateAlba If social media posts harass or threaten violence against Muslims, they should be removed. They are crimes @PoliceStateAlba I sometimes disagree with @TellMamaUK regarding where they draw the line. They are evolving. I have to start work now. .@PeterTatchell The police deal with crimes. Did Tell Mama report JihadistJoe for being 'offensive'. Do you condone that, 'if' they did? .@PeterTatchell Maybe you can work on Tell Mama supporting free speech rather than writing doublespeak website attacks on secularism. .@PeterTatchell Would Tell Mama draw the line if a satirist declared, ""Islam Nazis"" Is this a crime against Muslims? http://t.co/1juZExUiFP .@PeterTatchell https://t.co/8uhH07BmfL Tell Mama UK haven't changed, they are worse than ever.

It’s happening too fast to ignore any longer. @PeterTatchell @PoliceStateAlba Tatchell has also persistently campaigned to ban homophobic reggae music. @MoonMetropolis @PoliceStateAlba I've NOT campaigned to ban homophobic reggae music; only music that incites VIOLENCE against gays &amp; others @PeterTatchell @PoliceStateAlba Inciting violence is an IMMINENT thing, like handing someone a gun &amp; yelling ""SHOOT"": http://t.co/Jp8TmDkcn5 @PeterTatchell @PoliceStateAlba Encouraging the prosecution of music for ""inciting violence"" is a VERY dangerous slippery slope. @PeterTatchell @PoliceStateAlba If reggae can ""incite violence"", then so can just about any gangsta rap song. @PeterTatchell @PoliceStateAlba I HIGHLY doubt you'd consider it ""inciting violence"" if the lyrics called for violence against homophobes. @PeterTatchell @PoliceStateAlba Under Brandenburg v. Ohio, the mere ADVOCACY of violence is free speech. @PeterTatchell @MoonMetropolis @PoliceStateAlba Should Ice T have been arrested for singing ""Cop Killer""? What about ""I Shot the Sheriff""? @DreamerRyoko @MoonMetropolis @PoliceStateAlba They are not direct incitements &amp; were not followed by killings (which did occur in Jamaica) @PeterTatchell @MoonMetropolis @PoliceStateAlba Direct incitement would be the US standard of imminent lawless action. @PeterTatchell @MoonMetropolis @PoliceStateAlba I can think of numerous songs that directly encourage the killing of cops. @PeterTatchell @MoonMetropolis @PoliceStateAlba Also, you're using the same logic as people who blame heavy metal and hip-hop for murder. @DreamerRyoko @MoonMetropolis @PoliceStateAlba Jamaican rights groups confirm rise in anti-gay attacks after release of 'kill gays' songs @PeterTatchell @MoonMetropolis @PoliceStateAlba Several groups have stated that gang violence rises due to gangsta rap too. @PeterTatchell @MoonMetropolis @PoliceStateAlba Freedom of speech is not outcome-dependent. Speech can't MAKE people do anything. @PeterTatchell @MoonMetropolis @PoliceStateAlba The law is a blunt instrument. Give it the power to ban music &amp; that power WILL be abused. @PeterTatchell @MoonMetropolis @PoliceStateAlba Muhammed cartoons are said to cause violence too. Argument can be used to censor anything. @MayMayPoster @DreamerRyoko @MoonMetropolis @PoliceStateAlba Advocating violence is a serious criminal offence in the UK and most countries. @DreamerRyoko @PeterTatchell @PoliceStateAlba People like Tatchell never consider that censorship they advocate could be used against them. @MayMayPoster @PeterTatchell @DreamerRyoko @MoonMetropolis Let Peter declare 'Islam Nazis' in Cairo.

The beliefs themselves are shocking. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast why? @AllenStarr1 @thedailybeast because they are crass, Islamophobic and serve only to inflame tensions. Have some respect. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast Why? @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast The problem is with the people that take offense. They are clearly mentally unstable. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast the offended have the problem. They could choose not to be. @AllenStarr1 @thedailybeast absolutely wrong. It is codified in Islam that depictions of God or the Prophet are forbidden. @SlagBass @thedailybeast the cartoons are designed to be as provocative as possible, as you are well aware. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast and the bigger man is not provoked @thedailybeast Got shock? Cuz it ain't here. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast people really need to get a grip. All religion deserves ridicule. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast Sorry, but it is exactly the circumstances that warrant it--we don't want to be intimidated into silence. @SlagBass @thedailybeast the 'bigger man' doesn't create or publish this type of trash in the first place. 2 wrongs don't make a right. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast But we're not muslim. Don't you get that? @fdeperis @thedailybeast Tensions are extremely high and the cartoons are offensive. This is a time to talk peace, not share provocations. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast  It's religion. it's ridiculous - it deserves to be ridiculed. There really is no need for imaginary friends @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast As I said, mentally unstable to kill non-muslims for doing something that the are not forbidden to do. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast So shove this where the sun doesn't shine ... http://t.co/QjdOAprdcC @AllenStarr1 @thedailybeast uh huh, but it is not irrational as u claimed to be offended by them. And I take issue with the insensitivity. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast And this ... http://t.co/GOirTH9P2q @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast Except satire, unlike men with automatic weapons, is not an act of non-peace. @AllenStarr1 @thedailybeast you're a racist, Islamophobic moron. You and the terrorists are 2 sides of the same coin. Blocked. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast And, should I close my twitter account should someone find that women speaking their mind is 'offensive'? @fdeperis @thedailybeast hate speech isn't an act of peace. I'd call u a bully but ur not, ur just the buillies' laugh-along sidekick. @fdeperis @thedailybeast Nope. I'm just asking people to be considerate of the world's 1 billion+ Muslims &amp; not share those cartoons. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast Lots of people are offended by a lot of different things--do you eat pork? are you going to stop soon? @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast Satire is not hate speech. And how is a guy with a pen more of a bully than a guy with a gun? @fdeperis @thedailybeast no, but I don't go and stick a photo of me eating a bacon sandwich on my neighbour's door. @fdeperis @thedailybeast I never said he was. But I'm glad you can recognise their similarities. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast And how would that be satire? Again, satire &lt;&gt; hate speech/provocation. @fdeperis @thedailybeast it wouldn't be as offensive as publishing a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast What similarities?You must be trolling. You really want to compare being 'offended' to being savagely killed? @fdeperis @thedailybeast Not really. But what I'm saying is the killings don't retrospectively justify the provocations. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast The point is, no one has the right to kill/silence you for being offensive (unless they win a fair lawsuit). @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast But the entire point of satire IS being provocative. Banning 'offensiveness' is banning free speech.Gotta go. @fdeperis @thedailybeast think I missed the joke on the lawsuit bit, but otherwise I completely agree with you there. @fdeperis @thedailybeast ok now I get it, they can silence you if they win a lawsuit. Not kill you though! @fdeperis @thedailybeast not sure about banning it, but just because something's legal doesn't make it moral. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast But offensiveness IS NOT and CAN NOT be the measure of morality.Ugly world that would be: where would it end? @fdeperis @thedailybeast not saying nothing should ever be offensive, I'm saying caricaturing the Prophet is way over line of acceptability. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast Why? what makes Mohammed (or any other prophet) so special? My point exactly: https://t.co/wSBJZdDlHe @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast Evolution is 'way over the line of acceptability' for creationists, should we stop teaching it? @fdeperis @thedailybeast It's not the same. Criticising Islam is 1 thing, publishing caricatures of Muhammad is a no-no. @fdeperis @thedailybeast Sorry I was unclear there. I'm not saying never be offensive, but those cartoons are way way too far. @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast You still haven't explained why we should care about Muslim no-nos (more than creationst no-nos?). @fdeperis @thedailybeast it's a dumb comparison @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast What is? Please answer, why should we give a damn what Muslims find offensive? or any other religious group? @James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast Nobody forces Muslims to read Charlie Hebdo, why should freedom of speech be limited on their account? @fdeperis @thedailybeast Cos they're human beings &amp; there's no need to be a douche?

It started w  Reagan, followed w Bush Sr, Clinton kept it going, Bush Jr just blew it all up @wino75 @DLoesch Apparently, you do support Islamic jihad, else you would know that Iran was nearly westernized during the Shah. @Dagan81 @DLoesch But at least Carter and Reagan had the cold war to blame their stupidity on @wino75 @DLoesch You support jihad; you likely support the genocidal Saddam Hussein, who was manufacturing WMDs in the 1970s under Carter. @Dagan81 @DLoesch  I'm no Islamaphobe, but I detest Jihadis and ANY religious fundamentalists. Even your ""pet"" ones @wino75 @DLoesch You supported the Soviet expansion into Afghanistan and its role in attempting to establish a stronghold in Iran. @Dagan81 @DLoesch  it's people like you that feed the beast. Keep picking sides w zero knowledge or perspective. Stupid, crass ignorance @wino75 @DLoesch If the Shah was a dictator, than why are you sitting there supporting Khomeini? Why are you sitting there revising history? @Dagan81 @DLoesch  no, you dim fuck. Saying Reagan was stupid to do business w the Taliban and Jihadis doesn't equal loving communism twit @Dagan81 @DLoesch  I'm firing back sissy @wino75 @DLoesch Where is your evidence, Robbie? If you are so brilliant like an astute Marxist is, why do you like jihadists? #ISIS? @Dagan81 @DLoesch  I'm Canadian. We just have to suffer for your sniveling arrogance.

That's on YOU @wino75 @DLoesch I don't give a damn who you are; you're not an American. Keep your dysfunction North of me supporting parliament's attacks. @Dagan81 @DLoesch  lmao, if you call a brutal, homicidal dictatorship ""westernized"". Read a fucking book moron @Dagan81 @DLoesch  and given all sorts of chemical weapons to fight Iran by the US. Then ignored while using them to kill Kurds @wino75 @DLoesch When in doubt, you always pull the #RaceCard out. And if I am a racist, that is a compliment from a Nazi eugenicist. @Dagan81 @DLoesch  yet when he was a toothless, beaten memory, you fucks go in and kill a few hundred thousand civilians. Smart @wino75 @DLoesch I do read. Apparently, you spend time on your Little Red Bookj to grasp what non-revisionism actually is. @Dagan81 @DLoesch  no you fucking idiot. But I sure as shit didn't support misogynistic, raping imbeciles instead. @wino75 @DLoesch He may have died of Alzheimer's but you as a socialist would love to have fund him on your taxpayer's tip. Hypocrite. @Dagan81 @DLoesch wish I didn t have to suffer for what moronic, drooling conservative Americans cause in the world. Disgusting @wino75 @DLoesch Too bad so sad he saved the West from communism; blame Bush 41 on Afghanistan. @Dagan81 @DLoesch  it's possible to not support wither, but to support the people. You support the Shah, know NOTHING about him @wino75 @DLoesch And you still have never once addressed why you support jihad over Saddam or Khomeini since you support authority by force. @Dagan81 @DLoesch  this just shows your catastrophic ignorance. Mental midget @wino75 @DLoesch You mean like you love Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew? Ted Kennedy and JFK? Rapists, murderers and child sex traffickers? @wino75 @DLoesch Of course you are getting off track, but you are so incompetent at winning what you started you have to steer clear. @Dagan81 @DLoesch you're not French, so you can shut your fucking fat yap about anything that happens in Europe then. @Dagan81 @DLoesch try readin books that don't have cartoons in them dipshit @wino75 @DLoesch I don't give a damn if the Shah was evil; you still support jihad, and you are admitting this while denying riding a fence.

Get off the meth fool @Dagan81 @DLoesch  I support leaving nations to determine their own futures. I support safe zones and international efforts @wino75 @DLoesch Then why are you complaining about American presidents 30 years gone by? Why complain about Khomeini when he is Persian? .@Dagan81: Truth is, ""progressives"" historically side w/the most anti-western component. History proves this. @wino75 @DLoesch @wino75 @DLoesch Why do you exist only to serve as the bane of the universe? You oppose any variety of peace in favor of class warfare. @Dagan81 @DLoesch  I support  US and French weapons suppliers not making billions off phony wars that inspire jihadism @Dagan81 @DLoesch  I support people having some fucking knowledge before they spout off about things. @Dagan81 @DLoesch  well, I love Pierre Trudeau, was fond of Jack Layton. Big fan of Joe Clark (he was Conservative too). @Dagan81 @DLoesch but not to worry, your ignorance of world affairs shows all you read is RW blogs and TMZ. Sad and pitiful @wino75 @DLoesch It sure wasn't Gorbachev who ended the Cold War. He was bullied for years by Yeltsin, who was as drunk as you are blind. @Dagan81 @DLoesch  of course you don't care. Typical @wino75 @DLoesch Since Jimmy Carter seded Western superiority in the 1970s to  the Kremlin, you would be only too happy to have a red flag. @Dagan81 @DLoesch  nowhere have I stated this. Your revisionism starts quickly. Adjust that tinfoil hat fool @CHOWSTL @Dagan81 @DLoesch  false. Most of the rebels progressives support are very pro-West, just not pro-conservatism.

The terrorists that attacked Charlie Hebdo clearly don't, and they are not Muslims. @ZainabMadridsta I didn't say they didn't, but I think many would balk at idea of allowing insulting the prophet. @ZainabMadridsta I also don't think its useful or right to claim that anyone who does something wrong ""is not a Muslim"" works. @BPMiranda You clearly didn't read till the end @sunny_hundal weren't not allowed to tell you to stop insulting our leader? So I'm allowed to insult the Pope in front of you and you can @sunny_hundal call it freedom of speech? @sunny_hundal you obviously haven't studied Islam and the definition of a Muslim. Muslims don't murder people, it's against Islam. @ZainabMadridsta Read the article first please, I've addressed all that @sunny_hundal u make this about 'intolerant Muslims being easily offended',not larger colonial context of western destruction of Muslim life @sunny_hundal Please RT http://t.co/fXKjg0AYQ1 @sunny_hundal @mehdirhasan 1 thing that's always baffled me.Why is criticising Judaism anti semitism(crime ) &amp; criticising Islam freedom OS? @sunny_hundal embrace freedom of insult u mean? @sunny_hundal @mehdirhasan i agree with the right to reject other religion. But why the right to insult each other? Where is our morality? @ethiopiaeach right free speech is especially important when its the right to insult @tazsuarez77 Its not an insult to criticise Judaism, only to demonise Jews. Difference @BPMiranda So you think colonialism made Muslims less tolerant of free speech? @sunny_hundal we speak out &amp; defend our prophet and our religion when they are offended. We don't resort to violence our offensive comments @sunny_hundal it's *not* bout freedom of speech.its about how these cartoons participate in centuries-old discourse that dehumanizes Muslims @sunny_hundal But the right to questioning the religion is indeed important. But not to insult. It will resulted in chaos right. @sunny_hundal ok now I'm #confused :( ;) @sunny_hundal I never seen any case muslims insult any religions jew, christian or anything @sunny_hundal there is no compulsion in religion, of course not. We also have limits to how and when we can defend our prophet and religion @sunny_hundal so I think this is a two way thing, they can insult, but we also can defend. You missed that part. @ZainabMadridsta I didn't. READ IT PROPERLY @sunny_hundal you said we can be ""offended"" ,you didn't say we can defend. Jesus calm down I'm like 15. @BPMiranda what, and there aren't examples of imagery in Muslim countries that dehumanise others? @sunny_hundal how is that relevant? @BPMiranda Reality check: people in most places dehumanise people different to them. @sunny_hundal so that makes it OK? @BPMiranda ... but western countries far more tolerant to diversity than Arab or even South Asian countries @sunny_hundal I just don't understand how you want us to ""embrace"" freedom of speech, we already tolerate offensive comments... @sunny_hundal wow.i dont care.we are specifically talking about west.don't derail! @BPMiranda you were the one trying to justify censorship b/c of colonialism @sunny_hundal i am not justifying anything.i want us to be more critical of the narrative presented to us n not participate in it,which u do @BPMiranda the ""narrative"" isn't always about how Muslims are being haunted by colonialism. There are several issues at play here @BPMiranda And the article mentions examples of Sikhs trying the same kind of censorship, which I also opposed at the time @sunny_hundal i agree.but i dont see the dominant one,which propagates fear n hatred of muslims,being criticized here @BPMiranda I start with an image showing the racism that Asians faced in the past. Did you actually bother absorbing the piece...? @BPMiranda ... or are you just arguing because that's what you like doing all day? @sunny_hundal but again,u make it about of freedom of speech,not about how Charlie participated in a broader culture that vilifies Muslims @sunny_hundal wow,personal attack.And that, sir, is *how* you silence people.censorship works in many different ways u know @BPMiranda we're done here.

He shouldn't have resisted but should have been handled @llcoolmatt9 @Dilios_Spartans and while i wait for the 2nd answer that wont be accurate..who did eric garner provoke ? @INCIRCLEPROMO @Dilios_Spartans differently. You try and turn it into a race issue which just makes you the racist. @llcoolmatt9 @Dilios_Spartans maybe zimmerman should have kept on driving...shrugs.. @INCIRCLEPROMO @Dilios_Spartans sorry, Eric Garner didn't provoke. Mike Brown sure as hell did @llcoolmatt9 @Dilios_Spartans like i said... @INCIRCLEPROMO @Dilios_Spartans yea keep driving and ignore the guy acting suspicious who was on drugs and out of place. @INCIRCLEPROMO @Dilios_Spartans Mike Brown deserves to be 6ft under.

They're important. @llcoolmatt9 @Dilios_Spartans facts say otherwise...real facts.. @INCIRCLEPROMO @Dilios_Spartans facts say that DISPATCH told him not to follow. Dispatch are not the police. They answer a phone. @llcoolmatt9 @Dilios_Spartans the 911 operator told him not to...check the facts.. @INCIRCLEPROMO @Dilios_Spartans oh sorry, you said the police. But of a difference. One has legal authority. One does not. @INCIRCLEPROMO @Dilios_Spartans FACTS remain that Z did not break the law during the altercation. He was attacked. Defended his life. @llcoolmatt9 @Dilios_Spartans bottom line...u shoot a kid with juice and skittles...lol he was a coward-as well as u-based on your comments @INCIRCLEPROMO @Dilios_Spartans I'm not defending Z. He's an idiot. But Trayvon was a bigger one. Turned it physical and got dealt with @INCIRCLEPROMO @Dilios_Spartans the code in the ""hood"" as you call it...

About time we bombed Saudi Arabia don't you think? @ribzed @AkyolinEnglish 
I would have a huge impact on the moderates, this action would change them. Bombing is imprecise and many people there just live in fear.  I would love to see France do a mission which forcibly removed #Raif @ribzed @dloewen2 It wasn't serious. It was more a reference to how we happily turn a blind eye to what our friends in Saudi do. @dloewen2 So if @AkyolinEnglish drew a cartoon of a devil for example–to depict “their” prophet–you think (a) this would significantly (1) @dloewen2 @AkyolinEnglish ..shift “moderate” opinion and (b) this wouldn’t get twisted by his enemies into his depiction of the prophet?

POTUS can spew ANYTHING..and a certain % of people will believe &amp; repeat! @ChuckNellis same morons that think 9-11 was an inside job complete with hologram airplanes and Boston bombing was a set up @ChuckNellis Yeah. I would like to know that one too.Radicsl is radical,period.And evil is evil. @anglgrl58 Truth! :) @ChuckNellis Way above my pay grade because it looks like they are the same to me. @ChuckNellis ;) Radical that is...#typos. :-D @ChuckNellis @SOcean5 First of all no one is saying it is Isis, secondly there are 1.57 Muslims, only a handful belong to terror groups @ChuckNellis @SOcean5 That is like saying Catholics are all like IRA, or all Buddhist like the Monks killing Muslims. @oxfordgirl @SOcean5 Want to bet it was? If Muslims don't annihilate radicals they are complicit. @anglgrl58 @ChuckNellis Evil is evil and it exists in every religion, in every nation. It is people who kill not a religion of ideology @ChuckNellis come on quote, a pathological liar? @oxfordgirl @ChuckNellis Well put.There are laws of all lands. People ""should"" follow them and not hate one another because of differences. @ChuckNellis @Conservatexian It isn't Islam if you close your eyes, plug your ears,   and stick your head in the sand. Or if you're Obama. @ChuckNellis what surprises, me is at this point 6 years in, people act surprised when he blatantly, badly, lies. Ignore everything he says. @1Collier So many sheeple. @ChuckNellis scream loudly about everything he does. @ChuckNellis @SOcean5 Did Christian annihilate IRA? Are Buddhists wiping out the Monks killing Muslims. Don’t stir hatred, you r not helping @oxfordgirl @SOcean5 STAND AGAINST ISIS, SHOW ME! @Rojowo @ChuckNellis Exactly. They tried rebrand it to ""DAESH"" or some stupid word bc it doesn't include the word  ""Islam"". Problem solved. @ChuckNellis @SOcean5 Open your eyes a look. You are obviously so prejudiced you will not see beyond your own small-minded view. Bye @ChuckNellis @SOcean5 Ha ha, Tea Party, that explains a lot. Sorry no respect. Bye @oxfordgirl @SOcean5 Tea Party are independent thinkers, NOT SHEEP! @ChuckNellis @SOcean5 LOL, keep thinking that honey, you lot are the most closed minded people I have ever come across. Sad @oxfordgirl @SOcean5 I'd say the same is Islam. Sad. @ChuckNellis @SOcean5  actually I have spoken to some so-called Tea Party supporters that have the capacity to change and listen. not many @oxfordgirl @SOcean5 You don't know me or you wouldn't be so foolish, look at my profile &amp; 280K Tweets. @ChuckNellis @SOcean5 I am afraid not many people would really care what you say, that sort of prejudice is soon discovered and ignored @ChuckNellis @SOcean5 That’s a lot of tweets, have u nothing better to do? I am responding to the ignorance that attacks a religion as u do @oxfordgirl @SOcean5 I reach 500,000 people per Tweet &amp; have 4 times your followers, keep dreaming. Have a good day! :) @ChuckNellis @SOcean5 I have to admit that I have debated with some Tea Party members that were capable of seeing beyond their small world @oxfordgirl @SOcean5 You are a fool. If you keep this up I will send you to my followers to have fun with. :) @oxfordgirl @SOcean5 I've lived around the world &amp; am highly educated, know this. @ChuckNellis @SOcean5 and no one has ever heard of you. Try and look at the world with a some intellect @ChuckNellis @SOcean5 I have had better than you my friend. How silly you are. That in itself show who and what you are I'm done wasting my time with this fool, @oxfordgirl.  #Blocked @SOcean5 @ChuckNellis @SOcean5 lol @oxfordgirl @ChuckNellis @SOcean5 Because Muslims attack in the Name of Religion @KCRovin @ChuckNellis Matter of time. If it were here it would be workplace violence by three lone (?) wolves. That'd make sense, right? @dutsman @ChuckNellis @SOcean5 SOME MUSLIMS. As do some Christians. Have you forgotten Northern Ireland? 9-11 official story is suspicious. Not saying inside job, just dont believe it fully. Gov is complicit. 
@CMusky4213 @ChuckNellis @zanEcho @ChuckNellis let's hear this one lol Hear what one? Never trust the gov, period. 
@CMusky4213 @ChuckNellis @zanEcho @ChuckNellis that I understand , just want to hear how they are complicit @ChuckNellis read comments w @oxfordgirl &amp; hv followed her 6yrs-she's a sharp tongue Irianian Muslim who'll never convert 2 christianity! @ChuckNellis @oxfordgirl I think I missed all the fun this morning. Looks like you handled it CN :) @GirlFreedom @oxfordgirl She's blocked! :) @SOcean5 @oxfordgirl ;) @ChuckNellis  Yep figured that! Life's too short! Make a difference--my New Year's Resolution! @ChuckNellis @SOcean5 @oxfordgirl God idea to block that idiot!  Islam instructs followers to murder, Christianity instructs people to love! @stagingvera @ChuckNellis @SOcean5 You need to raed more about both Islam and Christianity @oxfordgirl @ChuckNellis @SOcean5 the study of what the Khoran teaches vs the New Testament clearly shows the reason Islam subjugates! Same way as with Northwoods, mk uktra, and tuskegee syphilis experiment.

The @NewYorker cartoonist's response to the #CharlieHebdo attack: http://t.co/uxDrVwl4M3,"@danielnyari @joolsd @NewYorker this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen @danielnyari I think it was made in 2012, Daniel. But what a picture.. @rebrandist @joolsd @NewYorker It's heavy handed but poignant nevertheless. @TPiccioni Sorry I should have clarified. Just found it relevant enough for today's event. no, it's facile @danielnyari @joolsd @NewYorker @danielnyari of course it is. So powerful. (and in fact it was published in 2006 http://t.co/unkhye3TsN) @danielnyari @KHShan @NewYorker Giving the Muslim terrorists exactly what they want. What an embarrassment to journalism! @gr8tale @KHShan @NewYorker It's satirical though. @danielnyari @LauraVanVleet @NewYorker  Thank God Islam is the religion of peace, or they'd have killed two dozen. @DanCChamberlain Be careful your ignorance and superficial views are showing.  @danielnyari @NewYorker @LauraVanVleet @danielnyari @NewYorker Coddle a religion that allows men to marry 12 year old girls, and cut the heads off those who object? @DanCChamberlain Jihadists don't represent every Muslim. &amp; to be so glib about the quantity of people murdered. @danielnyari @NewYorker @LauraVanVleet @DanCChamberlain @NewYorker agreed Laura. Let's not fall into the typical Western neo-liberal/right wing trap here. @LauraVanVleet @danielnyari @NewYorker Glib? It's an atrocity and thank God the cartoonist hadn't upset the methodists... @LauraVanVleet I see you retweeted something about anti-bullying, yet you are defending a religion that allows a man to punish his wife? @DanCChamberlain Okay, that made me laugh. @danielnyari @NewYorker @LauraVanVleet @danielnyari @NewYorker If Islam is a religion of peace, why would its practitioners live in fear of their fellow followers? @DanCChamberlain There are many passages in the King James Bible that pretty much say the same thing. I defend no religion, but the people @LauraVanVleet Yes, that argument is often used. We ""used"" to allow slavery too, but the enlightened have moved on to the New Testament now @LauraVanVleet Just so you know, I'm not religious. I'm just tolerant of all religions as long as THEY are tolerant as well. @DanCChamberlain No organized religion was or is entirely peaceful. Remember the inquisition?  @danielnyari @NewYorker @DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet @NewYorker You know the majority of the Muslim population regularly condemn these brutal actions? @DanCChamberlain Tolerance will not educate or make change. Quick naive judgments need more than just tolerance. @danielnyari @LauraVanVleet Condemn? My God, tens of thousands of fellow Muslims can no longer condemn anything as their throats are cut! @danielnyari @LauraVanVleet Condemn with what? Rhetoric? Then they are in good company. Rhetoric is in heavy supply in your camp. @LauraVanVleet Yes, quick naive judgements like all police are racists. There is more than enough naiveté to go around. @LauraVanVleet All religions are not equal. Religions that oppress based on sex, belief, sexual orientation etc cannot be supported. Period. @DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet Again the problem with your argument is that it's a blanket statement you can apply to any religion/ideology @DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet which remains true. ""if christianity is religion of peace, etc"". for sake of argument let's presume any @DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet ideology can be hijacked. fundamentalism often has nothing to do with religion but with authoritarianism. @DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet In this case it's the problem of a perception of cultural intrusion, fighting own temptation to integrate. @danielnyari @LauraVanVleet Daniel, the ""fundamentals"" of Islam already place ""Man"" in a position of authoritarianism over woman. @danielnyari @LauraVanVleet Christianity has accepted that woman is a partner. In spite of the Old Testament, Christianity does preach love. @DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet Except against Homosexuals right? @danielnyari @LauraVanVleet Wrong. I know of no western religious leader that promotes the persecution of gays. Isis tosses them to death! @DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet What about the subject of gay union in the eyes of God? Look, this isn't the point. Yea there might be @DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet varying degrees of interpretation of freedom, which is always relative to socio-economic context, etc but @DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet when we talk about terrorists THIS good/evil argument is the problem and avoids the fundamental questions @DanCChamberlain No death by burning, true, but they make it clear gays are not welcome...  @danielnyari @DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet which don't really have to do with religion. If you want to have that debate, that's separate and NOT @DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet for you but the Muslim community to debate over. @danielnyari @LauraVanVleet The ""Fundamental"" question is, will Islamic leaders ever recognize the human rights of those who dissent? @DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet No it's not. Not in this argument. Because that's not what spawned ISIS and various fundamentalist groups. @LauraVanVleet @danielnyari Laura, again, I know of no sane Christian religious leader who preaches hate against gays. No one is excluded... @LauraVanVleet @danielnyari The whole ""marriage"" vs ""union"" debate is silly. However, journalists will allow the bashing of Christianity... @LauraVanVleet @danielnyari even embrace it, but they run in fear of bashing Islam...almost religiously! Journalists are a fucking joke. @DanCChamberlain Recommended reading. ""hijacking of Islam by the Taliban"" http://t.co/C4Xxw3x1hr @danielnyari @LauraVanVleet @danielnyari Malala is a wonder. The UN pays lip service to her courage and cause. @LauraVanVleet @danielnyari Also, for the record, even ""moderate"" Islamic leaders for the most part, ""hate"" the existence of Israel. @LauraVanVleet @danielnyari No one ""Hijacked"" Islam. Islam made it possible to justify horrible acts in its name... @DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet there's an argument for pro-western liberal anti Islam-bashing yes but its inverse also equally deterrable @LauraVanVleet @danielnyari If the Catholics started murdering, journalists would immediately point to the Old Testament and say the bible.. @LauraVanVleet @danielnyari taught the hate! @DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet This quick read is gateway into right perspective towards issue i'll leave it at that http://t.co/9BENju8zyd @danielnyari @LauraVanVleet Guys, enjoyed it.

The response to #CharlieHebdo should be to reprint his work and spread it wider than his killers could have thought possible,"@LouiseMensch every paper in Europe. Front page. @LouiseMensch I bet too many media outlets are afraid for themselves to do this. @DavidShipleySCA thanks I will @LouiseMensch start by retweeting this Louise, or are you really a muslim apologist? http://t.co/yZQgs5wZF8 @DavidShipleySCA @LouiseMensch That's what @MarkGSparrow said, Louise, and has attracted a very strange set of respondents. @LouiseMensch 

Reprint and we will re kill

Until you respect our prophet , like you respect the zionism or jews Fair play to finger-on-the-pulse @LouiseMensch for her support for Monsieur Hebdo. https://t.co/A61pbKRJ7i @hannigancork oh lord. @LouiseMensch And give all satirists Uzi licenses. Boy oh boy does @LouiseMensch know how to spread the hate. &amp; loves to do it too, by begging for more hate cartoons @seanieBM Beggers belief! .@NajdPlateau I do not fear you or your murderous brothers. I know true Muslims and they do not kill for free speech @LouiseMensch agree, every newspaper etc should have their work on the front page tomorrow! @LouiseMensch

Mind you I only went to Bedales so what do I know? @LouiseMensch &gt;&gt;&gt;@NajdPlateau Its people like you who bring dishonour to the Prophet (pbuh) and Islam. You should be ashamed of yourself @NajdPlateau that is your belief not mine. Is Allah (SWT) weak? Does he desire these deaths? Is He not compassionate and merciful? Fuck you @NajdPlateau I've reprinted. What are you going to do? @LouiseMensch http://t.co/OLAtfgZGWQ @LouiseMensch @NajdPlateau I condemn this act bt making fun of other religions by cartoons is wrong.They made pic of prophet(P.B.U.H). @kashaf1256 @NajdPlateau it is rude, it is offensive and unpleasant. It is also free speech to offend us religious folk @LouiseMensch 

Can you talk about the crimes of the Jews in Palestine ? 

But Ironically talking about the Prophet mohamed is free speech @NajdPlateau I don't believe you are a Muslim. Why to do sport the Rabia sign when they have nothing to do with terrorism @LouiseMensch @LouiseMensch let's be clear here - death for insulting Islam/Mohammed is enshrined in Quran and Hadiths. It IS true Islam, sadly. “@NajdPlateau: @LouiseMensch

""RESPECT MY RELIGION I WILL RESPECT URS"" @j_razor101 I agree whn u make fun of anyones belief again nd again then they do such thingsnd when such a stage comes they cant see clearly @kashaf1256 which is their problem to resolve, not the critics. Time people grew a backbone. @j_razor101 What is ur belief???i mean r u an atheist,christian or what???? @kashaf1256 @LouiseMensch @NajdPlateau I respect all religions. I also can see satire for what it is. @j_razor101 THEN IT WILL BECOME A WILDEST DREAM TO BRING PEACE IN THE WORLD @kashaf1256 we have relatively peace here in the UK, where every idea is open to critique. How do you explain that? @kashaf1256 atheist. @j_razor101 Cuz GOD is supreme he doesnt need to defend himself its us who need to defend themselves cuz we r flawed .@kashaf1256 not over cartoons you don't. Just deal with it.

I was responding to @4010236 re: 'Islamic prophet' but I'd also add that when ppl kill for such nonsense we KNOW their religion. @Letha_Hughes @4010236 No one knows WHY they killed those poor folks. Jumping to conclusions and supporting them can be dangerous. @ScotsFox71 
They yelled it from the top of their lungs... That their prophet had been 'avenged'. What part do you not understand?
@4010236 @Letha_Hughes @4010236 Anyone can shout that,&amp; i watched the video too,they also shouted Alluhu Akbar.Doesn't MEAN they were Islamic/Muslim. @ScotsFox71

Um, no @firstatheist @blastedsilver @AaronWorthing @UseYourSynapses @blastedsilver I guess. I dunno. I'm just really sad and angry-cartoons aren't soothing my atheist heart. @firstatheist I am speaking for myself: I don't desire ""unity"" w/Muslims that want to kill me or force me to live THEIR way @AaronWorthing @AaronWorthing @blastedsilver unity within humanity, my friend. We've all gotta live on this planet when the blood...or ink...dries. @blastedsilver @AaronWorthing oh me neither. But are we trying to rise above or stoop here? Coexistence is only possible if everyone learns to tolerate blasphemy @firstatheist @blastedsilver @AaronWorthing @blastedsilver @firstatheist @UseYourSynapses Can we have both? @firstatheist I think we are all sad and angry...

I appreciete the positive spirit but…. @Cathy_Torres @UncleRUSH  White supremacists terrorists call themselves ""christians"" I guess you can say Christians and Christianity is evil @AlbanyCharlie @UncleRUSH  their are people who kill innocent people in Palestine and steal their land &amp; call themselves Jews. @AderemiOladipo get a Qur'an and read it .

My point is that they're not true #Muslims @MartyMcKay @UncleRUSH When evil is committed by people who call themselves Jews &amp; Christians. Should we condemn the entire faith? @Words545 - That's exactly my point. I said they pretended that they have retaliated on behalf of Prophet Mohammed (PBUH). @Cathy_Torres they call themselves Christians. So do I condemn the faith of Christianity because of what terrorists do in the name of jesus @DatMobile @UncleRUSH  what have u been smoking? They blow up churches and light crosses in people's yard. @Words545 @UncleRUSH You living in the past. It's 2015 , not 1960.

They burned the Seven Eleven too! @DatMobile @UncleRUSH GOOD , now your mask is coming off. @DioscorusBoles terrorists using Islam to justify heinous acts are not Muslim, they are terrorists. @UncleRUSH @Chereenz @Fieryreddragon @UncleRUSH @Chereenz and why are the terrorists in Myanmar Buddhist,  hypocrite and coward? @DioscorusBoles you are a Coptic Christian?

You should be anti-black! @DatMobile whites kill more whites.

Well done 👏 @totalkharnage @stephenfry - it shows how feeble some folks are. Getting offended over a cartoon and then killing for it.  that is insane! @tom_wigmore_ @MaxD17 @stephenfry 'comics'?? Really? They intentionally set out to cause offence and the French govt explicitly advised them @totalkharnage @stephenfry biggest insult to their memory would be to concede to fear as the terrorists want. Spread the pix to honor them @tom_wigmore_ @MaxD17 @stephenfry on numerous occasions not to do it. None of which condones in the slightest what the terrorists did tho @totalkharnage @stephenfry doesn't show dead people anything. Shows terrorists that they won't silence ideas. Shows solidarity w/ survivors. @Greyhound1405 @stephenfry I totally agree. @totalkharnage @MaxD17 @stephenfry so you're saying it's okay that terrorists killed 12 people because they disagreed with free speech? @MaxD17 @stephenfry But in the process, continuing to offend Muslims. I agree with this view http://t.co/021W5I8115 @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ @MaxD17 @stephenfry Its your choice to take offence. Make better choices. @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ @MaxD17 @stephenfry It's your choice to take offence. Make better choices. @docslacker @stephenfry And continues to offend mainstream Muslims. It was and is 'stupid' http://t.co/021W5I8115 @kirstym01189085 @totalkharnage @MaxD17 @stephenfry absolutely agree. Saying ""I disagree with your point"" is okay - massacre is not. @tom_wigmore_ if you read the second part of my tweet, you'll see I in no way condone that and it's horrific. @totalkharnage @stephenfry It sounds like you are happy they were shut up. People who kill over a cartoon are the problem, not the cartoon. @totalkharnage @stephenfry so what. No one has the right to be protected from being offended. Charlie Hebdo also satirised Jews &amp; Christians @totalkharnage but you are saying we roll over and allow the terrorists the freedom to kill, as free expression should be repressed, no? @tom_wigmore_ @kirstym01189085 @MaxD17 @stephenfry Agreed and no sane person would say otherwise but that's the point, the terrorists aren't @totalkharnage @stephenfry the answer is more speech. Speak out, speak out against terrorists who hijack your religion. @totalkharnage @kirstym01189085 @MaxD17 @stephenfry but you're still missing the fact that if we hide the posts, the terrorists win. @BaKaiyaTeru @stephenfry it 'sounds' like I'm happy?? What planet are you on. You sound like George Bush 'with us or against them' @totalkharnage @stephenfry offend them more. Offend Christians, atheists, Jews, Asians. Makes no difference.Who cares that they're offended? @totalkharnage @stephenfry you can't say a religion is a religion of peace and love and then threaten to kill those who insult it. @MJIBrown @stephenfry That question is offensive bro. @docslacker @stephenfry Did they have a special edition satirising Christians and Jews? They intentionally targeted Islam to get publicity @totalkharnage @stephenfry You keep blaming the victim, maybe you want to look into that first. @tom_wigmore_ no. Everyone should and has free speech but most people use that responsibly. I have the right to shout Fire but don't do so @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ @kirstym01189085 @stephenfry what if I'm offended that women are allowed to speak out of turn? @totalkharnage @docslacker @stephenfry Yes.

Next question, or are you just going to keep being an ignorant apologist? @tom_wigmore_ on a crowded train or theatre. What did they gain by doing this when no other publications did? @totalkharnage take 5 minutes to google Charlie covers. Their take on the Christian trinity and homophobia is pretty harsh. @totalkharnage you're missing the point of satire. It's supposed to be borderline comedy. Those who take it otherwise need thicker skins. @docslacker @stephenfry You mean like all the major Muslim nations have? http://t.co/EfTEsokdbX @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ they set out to make a point. They did. @tom_wigmore_ @kirstym01189085 @MaxD17 @stephenfry Win what? And what do we gain? @totalkharnage their covers lampooning Catholic Church hypocrisy, the inability to criticise jewish extremism, etc... @MaxD17 @stephenfry what do we gain other than offending mainstream people? @tom_wigmore_ @totalkharnage @MaxD17 @stephenfry Fuck you islam, fuck you christian, fuck you invisible friend illness spreader. @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ @kirstym01189085 @stephenfry they want to instill fear.To dictate our lives. Silencing free speech is surrender @totalkharnage by saying something no one else would. They spoke out and continued through oppression. And now the world looks on agreeing @BaKaiyaTeru @stephenfry I do think they were incredibly stupid but again, nothing justifies terrorism. Nothing. @MaxD17 @tom_wigmore_ @kirstym01189085 @stephenfry Feel free to be offended and I defend your right to feel such way and speak out about it. @totalkharnage @stephenfry That they were ""stupid"" is irrelevant and an insult to them. Maybe they were just braver than you. @totalkharnage and I am glad and hopeful Arab and Muslim leaders are speaking out. It is a turning point. I want to support moderates. @BaKaiyaTeru @docslacker @stephenfry  apologist for what? Just because I disagree with the cartoons makes me an  apologist for terrorists? @totalkharnage @MaxD17 @kirstym01189085 @stephenfry don't the cartoonists have the right to speak out about religions then? @tom_wigmore_ Not sure ending up dead and being firebombed is worth the laughs but that's a decision every person makes themselves. @MaxD17 @tom_wigmore_ Which is? @BonnettJosh @stephenfry not a rhetorical question. I care about freedom of speech &amp; the policeman's family, so the issue troubles me. @totalkharnage @stephenfry why should there be another objective? Offense can be their objective and still be valid. @RaAmarr1 @tom_wigmore_ @MaxD17 @stephenfry Again, intelligent comeback. Well done. @totalkharnage @BaKaiyaTeru disagree with the cartoons. But what can you expect when you criticise people for refusing to be silenced? @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ they published hundreds of comics. I'm sure you're savvy enough to extrapolate some meaning from a few. @totalkharnage @MaxD17 ""fuck you, oppression"". @BonnettJosh @stephenfry people should be free to repost the offending cartoons, but is this a reasonable thing to do? @tom_wigmore_ And what were they saying other than causing offence, intentionally? @totalkharnage Death is the extreme. But these cartoonists stood for what they believed in the face of adversity. That's admirable. @BaKaiyaTeru @stephenfry 'Braver'. One mans bravery is another mans stupidity. Idolising them now they're dead is easy to do. @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ @MaxD17 @stephenfry Awww. Are you offended? Are you !slam? You must be. I have two words, can u figure them out @totalkharnage It's SATIRE. Would you have this much angst against The Onion? They had messages to say, and they told them. @MaxD17 @stephenfry And I reserve the right to be offended and to speak up. Why is that difficult to understand? Not advocating violence tho @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ And here, in a quiet corner of Twitter, is the problem entirely. @MaxD17 @tom_wigmore_ Help me because I fail to understand it. @totalkharnage @docslacker @stephenfry tough tatties if people take offence, it's satire. That's the point. No need to look if it's annoying @totalkharnage @MaxD17 @tom_wigmore_ @kirstym01189085 @stephenfry the whole world is offended by what happened the offensive part was death. @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ Are firebombs and bullets are a worthy response to satire? Are you actually implying people should be silent? @tom_wigmore_ Oh give me a break. Just mindless platitudes that are used in the papers and news to make them look like heroes. Total tripe @totalkharnage @stephenfry you are saying we should censor the images or at least their spread, because it is offensive. That is the issue @tom_wigmore_ Why is it difficult for you to understand that I don't have to agree with everything the Lord @stephenfry says? Move on. @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ you do know us lot in Europe have been brought up with the ideal of free speech? Its our right! @StanleyBurgoyne @tom_wigmore_ What's the problem with disagreeing with someones point of view and why are you so offended by that? @totalkharnage @MaxD17 @stephenfry You should be more offended by those who use your religion to firebomb and kill. @totalkharnage @stephenfry I'm not saying agree with Stephen Fry, at all. I'm saying realise that you're apologising for terrorists. @Boulton101 @docslacker @stephenfry Agreed. I take offence but I'm not about to commit murder. People disagree, it's a democracy. Move on. @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ a few points I can see -religions are hypocritical. Politicians (at least some) are corrupt. Etc. multiple.duh? @solastary @tom_wigmore_ No &amp; no. You can disagree, be offended and not advocate violence. A distinction that some on Twitter find difficult @totalkharnage I will defend your right to belief what you want. I will stand against those who want to impose their beliefs on others. @MaxD17 @stephenfry Again, do not see what is gained in the slightest from this at all. Why have many publications not published them? @Themightydodgy_ @tom_wigmore_ I was born &amp; bred in the UK so when you say 'us lot in Europe', I'm one of you. Stop being offensive. @totalkharnage @stephenfry no one is forcing them to publish anything. You are either trolling or quite illogical in this it seems. @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ well get on the same page then. @solastary @MaxD17 @stephenfry And why can't I be both? It's not a zero sum game. Again, you can be against both although I place murder @solastary @MaxD17 @stephenfry much higher up the list than publishing some stupid, thoughtless cartoons. @tom_wigmore_ @stephenfry Oh dear god. So thinking the cartoons are stupid is apologising for terrorists? There goes any logical argument. @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ 1. Then go out there and teach your young men what is a worthy response. Teach them that firebombs... @docslacker No problem at all with that. @totalkharnage @solastary @stephenfry they were not thoughtless. You don't get it. Never will. @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ 2. ... And bullets are not the answer. Go to your mosques and root out the ones preaching violence. @MaxD17 @stephenfry Not trolling mate. I think you can be for free speech, against terrorism and still not republish the cartoons. Simple. @Themightydodgy_ @tom_wigmore_ Why should I?? So because I disagree with your point of view, I'm not 'one of you'?? We live in a democracy!! @totalkharnage @MaxD17 @stephenfry If you are go out there and do something about it. Start reaching out to those angry young men. @totalkharnage @stephenfry then you're just wrong. @solastary @tom_wigmore_ Oh dear god. 'Teach your young ones' sorry but there are 1.6 billions Muslims in the world, what % do you think @solastary @tom_wigmore_ are terrorists. You make it sound like most young Muslims are terrorists which is what some in the media peddle. @MaxD17 @stephenfry And that's your point of view. I disagree. End of civil conversation. @totalkharnage @BaKaiyaTeru @stephenfry Funny u say the ""with us or against us"" line. I know a religion that says the same. 'Kill infidels' @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ 1. A very tiny one. But one which has had a huge impact on ppls lives. I do not support the issues which... @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ 2... Make extremists kill, yet people like me are affected by the attacks. You have the responsibility... @ZebraPinstriped @BaKaiyaTeru @stephenfry Read the Old Testament lately? http://t.co/uQBT3RF0zl @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ @MaxD17 @stephenfry btw what's yours? Don't piss of religion of peace, they might kill you? @MJIBrown @stephenfry Anything less gives in to islamist insanity. @solastary @tom_wigmore_ few nutters is stupid and illogical. Move one. @MJIBrown @stephenfry We can't be cowards. They are drawings FFS. @BonnettJosh @stephenfry right. Respect freedom of speech but also choose to respect the policeman's family (and other law abiding muslims). @totalkharnage @ZebraPinstriped @BaKaiyaTeru looking to the day 99% of muslims treat scripture same way 99% Christians &amp; Jews treat theirs. @BonnettJosh @stephenfry absolutely. A heinous crime and expression of ideas must be protected. Being respectful is a choice. @docslacker @ZebraPinstriped @BaKaiyaTeru Exactly my point. @MJIBrown @stephenfry Muslims are the greatest victims of their own silly religion. @BonnettJosh @stephenfry given contrast between the muslim terrorist &amp; muslim policeman, I'm avoiding sweeping generalisations. @totalkharnage @docslacker yes, religious books are crap including OT. Real problem is all follwers think there's not a word wrong in Q book @totalkharnage @docslacker The day ppl r ready to admit portions of these books could be wrong &amp; outdated, the world would be a lot better @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ you fucking imbecile. To talk of 'offence' in the face of murder. There speaks the voice of moderate Islam. @StanleyBurgoyne @tom_wigmore_ another intelligent response.  Glad you exercise your right of free speech. Blocked. @totalkharnage @MaxD17 then you missed the point of #FreeSpeech if your claim a god exists like Thor, Ra or allah without offering proof @totalkharnage @MaxD17 @tom_wigmore_ @stephenfry Defend your right by using guns and killing people. Grow up. Satire is healthy in society @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ @kirstym01189085 @MaxD17 @stephenfry Terrorists follow an ideology rather than having a mental illness. @robinandlindsay @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ @MaxD17 @stephenfry They use religion to control. They are fascists. We need humour @totalkharnage @docslacker @stephenfry That sounds like a threat. @PatrickRomSim @docslacker @stephenfry how so? @totalkharnage @docslacker @stephenfry Uh...ok. Guess that says it all right there. @PatrickRomSim @docslacker @stephenfry because I accuse them of being stupid, means I'm threatening them? You must have a really thin skin @totalkharnage @docslacker @stephenfry Basically u are saying if u continue to offend Muslims u r stupid &amp; deserve any repercussions. @PatrickRomSim @docslacker @stephenfry Erm, no. That's what YOU just said. Why continually assume I mean one thing when I said the opposite? @totalkharnage @docslacker @stephenfry whatever, back track all you want, you still come off as a terrorist sympathizer &amp; apologist. @PatrickRomSim @docslacker @stephenfry aaaaaand we finally get there. Took your time. All boils down to that in the end. @totalkharnage @docslacker @stephenfry was literally the point myself and others were making to be fair... “@totalkharnage: @ZebraPinstriped @BaKaiyaTeru @stephenfry Read the Old Testament lately? http://t.co/RvMJE6Jv5w”",non-rumours
British press publish horrifying photos of police officer being murdered - but not Charlie Hebdo cartoons. Strange values. #JeSuisCharlie,"@polblonde The British press don't HAVE values. @polblonde @RichardDawkins same in Australia. Craven and shameful. @polblonde @RichardDawkins I see nothing wrong with it. It is the reality which is hidden and not felt. @polblonde @RichardDawkins Press that doesn't publish the cartoons are COWARDS @polblonde @RichardDawkins Not strange values, just cowardice. Unlike France, religious nut jobs have already achieved their aim in the UK. @polblonde Britain is full of sniveling cowards these days. It is disgraceful. @polblonde @RichardDawkins British Values: Greed Based System of Inherited Privilege enforced by state violence and inbred complicit courts. @polblonde did any British newspaper publish the cartoons ? in india at least one newspaper has shown the courage http://t.co/fOUUjFdkoL @polblonde @RichardDawkins Because they're scared shitless of the PC backlash. Remember, the government panders to the minority. @polblonde Craven but 'protection of staff' argument works. Noone wants that responsibility. Thus we are all tyrannised by this ideology. @polblonde @RichardDawkins http://t.co/fauxBPP5f8 @polblonde @RichardDawkins my naive guess lots of terrorism/terrorists funding media @foogol @RichardDawkins If you were a friend or relative of the murdered police officer, you might feel differently. @polblonde @RichardDawkins somebody could be offended... @polblonde @RichardDawkins they are moral cowards, pure and simple. @polblonde @RichardDawkins I wouldn't! Thanks for the reply. @polblonde The UK is firmly under the jackboot of political correctness. @polblonde media should be clear whether self-censorship is so as not to 'offend' perceived religious sensibilities or to protect staff. @HDBrighton I take protection of staff seriously, though many would accept risk. No risk showing man being shot dead but painful for family. @polblonde agree. @mathewhump No, publishing the cartoons serves the terrorists' goal of inciting hatred of Muslims, which will only bring them more recruits. @thomin Or, as has been shown in the past, a harsh reaction against Muslims will create more sympathy and recruits for the extremists. 1/ @thomin There have already been several attacks against mosques in France today. That only serves the agenda of the terrorists. @PhilSEE28 No, inciting more anger against Muslims only serves the interests of the terrorists, who use it to drum up recruits and support. @maklelan but ANYTHING incites their violence, the very fact YOU are not a Muslim is enough reason for them to be violent, so unless... @maklelan you are a total pacifist and are willing to alter every aspect of your life and freedom to appease Muslims, you must fight... @maklelan the ideology at every turn, its like saying we must accept racism otherwise racist will be violent, it's a cowards reasoning. @PhilSEE28 No, that's silly and juvenile rhetoric. The vast majority of Muslim violence is in direct response to occupation or aggression 1/ @PhilSEE28 apart from what is done explicitly to create an atmosphere of anger that will only elicit more sympathy for their cause. @PhilSEE28 You have no idea what I am, but I can you're phenomenally uninformed when it comes to terrorism and Islam, just like Dr. Dawkins. @PhilSEE28 It's absolutely nothing like that whatsoever. You need to listen instead of just waiting to try to poke holes in the issue. @PhilSEE28 You're doing exactly what Cheney and Bush and the others did when they made the worst decision the US has made in a century. @maklelan I have not time to debate with apologists for jihad, the ""if only we were nice to them they would stop killing us"" rhetoric... @PhilSEE28 No, of course not. You've only got time for unthinking bigotry and hatred. @maklelan has been debunked countless times. more Muslims are killed by other Muslims than by anyone else, so that renders your argument... @PhilSEE28 No, it's not been debunked, you're just mindlessly suckling at the fetid and swollen teat of ignorant Islamophobia. @maklelan that its the west fault and all our own doing completely void. stop making excuses for their 6th century violent psychopathy. @maklelan you know you've lost the debate when you start rattling off ""bigotry"" and ""islamophobia"" @PhilSEE28 You lost the debate when you signed on as a sycophant to someone who knows absolutely nothing about Islam or terrorism. @maklelan all you need to do to know about Islam and Terrorism is be alive in this world, Islam will do the rest for you. @PhilSEE28 Actually Muslims only account for 10% of world's terrorist attacks. Secularists are the majority. Get an education on this topic. @maklelan not a man fond of providing proof are you? yet you have the nerve to tell me to educate myself. @PhilSEE28 Cavanaugh, The Myth of Religious Violence; Paper, Cutting the Fuse; Kruglanski, The Psychology of Terrorism . . . @PhilSEE28 Crenshaw, Explaining Suicide Terrorism; I can point to dozens of other books and articles after you've read those texts. @PhilSEE28 *Pape, not Paper. Silly autocorrect. @maklelan books on these subjects are usually biased, I prefer viewing debates between intellectuals, which is where I base my opinion. @PhilSEE28 So you base it on rhetoric instead of on scholarship. I see. Why not read the scholarship instead of just assume? @maklelan that would be quite an indictment vs Islam if that was all it took...and they just capitulate? @thomin Not at all. Group solidarity is the salient factor, and it works the same way with secular ideologies and their terrorists. @maklelan not rhetoric, intellectuals debating in a public forum who are then fact checked after debates. as opposed to your pro jihad books @PhilSEE28 Debates are about rhetoric, not facts. Nobody attends a fact-checking session, and just dismissing scholarship because it 1/",non-rumours
So now let's talk seriously about #CharlieHebdo and Western double standard on freedom of speech http://t.co/X8iyp64azl,". @LatuffCartoons your art speaks loud enough , can't make those who dont want to open up their eyes see it .. @LatuffCartoons Hey, at least the ADL doesn't riddle you with bullets for making anti-Israeli cartoons. ""@LatuffCartoons:So now let's talk seriously about #CharlieHebdo &amp; Western double standard on freedom of speech” http://t.co/4l31P6Lw0L @TjerkMuller Defending pro-Israel lobby? Shit, man... @LatuffCartoons @MariaLaoise not true. #CharieHebdo lampooned Judaism and Christianity as well. #JeSuisCharlie @janetravers @MariaLaoise Sorry to disappoint you, Jane http://t.co/EnQSPes4MT @janetravers Not nearly as much as it lampooned Islam. Islam first &amp; foremost, Catholcism second, Orthodox Judaism third @LatuffCartoons @janetravers That's the impression I've formed from seeing multiple Charlie cartoons. @LatuffCartoons @LatuffCartoons Oh, is it going to be like that? See, you like to draw pictures to make a point; I like to sketch *arguments* to make mine. @MariaLaoise I wonder if that reflects the efforts of various extremist groups to repress free speech? I suspect such... @LatuffCartoons 1/2 @MariaLaoise @LatuffCartoons ...efforts primarily came from the extremists in Islam. 2/2 @LatuffCartoons @youyou2A Charlie Hebdo did make fun about every religions! You should know BETTER ! @LaurenceGuenoun @youyou2A Unless when dealing with the good old ""anti-Semtism"" http://t.co/EnQSPes4MT @LatuffCartoons @youyou2A You surely don't know Charlie Hebdo...

Έχω δει λάθος; @islandlayer νομίζω όντως το είδες λάθος. Ή εσύ ή εγω. Δεν επιμένω, ας το ξανασκεφτεί ο καθένας μας @LatuffCartoons @youyou2A I did. And ? @janetravers Please don't pretend you're interested in civilised interaction &amp; then support tweets abusing me knowing it will show up ... @SikanasGiorgos Μιλάει για τα διπλά σταθμά στη δύση με το οποίο συμφωνώ απολύτως. Δεν βλέπω κάτι άλλο. @janetravers ... in my notifications. That, IMO, is the height of rudeness. @LatuffCartoons @youyou2A (keep your insults with your lack of intelligence, please!) @MariaLaoise that, IMHO, is free speech. @janetravers We have a choice on here: respectful interaction or abuse/ridicule. They are mutually exclusive. @islandlayer δεν εκφράζεται ενιαία η ""Δύση"".  Δύση είμαστε, βλέπετε να εκφραζόμαστε ταυτόσημα; @MariaLaoise I have never abused or ridiculed you. If I liked a turn of phrase in another tweet and favourite it, that's my preogative. If.. @MariaLaoise ...you wish to use that as an excuse not to engage with me, that's YOUR prerogative. @SikanasGiorgos Πάμε πάλι. Μπορεί να κάνω και λάθος. Εγώ κατάλαβα πως για τα μέτρα των δυτικών ΜΜΕ όταν σκιτσογραφείς Εβραίους είσαι -&gt; @SikanasGiorgos -&gt; φιλοναζί ενώ όταν σκιτσογραφείς μουσουλμάνους σε καλύπτει η ελευθερία του λόγου. Δείχνει κάτι άλλο; Και μου μίλησες για-&gt; @SikanasGiorgos φούρνους. Αντιναζί είμαι από τα γεννοφάσκια μου @janetravers I am open to interaction but in order for interaction to be meaningful and fruitful a certain amount of mutual respect ... @janetravers ... is required. That is all I ask. .@MariaLaoise you're repeating yourself now. Engage with me or don't, but don't hide behind indignation because I liked another tweet. @islandlayer να συμφωνήσουμε σε μερικά πράγματι. Η ""Δύση"" και τα δυτικά ΜΜΕ δεν εκφράζονται ενιαία και στρατευμένα. Λειτουργούν ελεύθερα &gt;&gt; @islandlayer και από διαφορετικές θέσεις. Ευτυχώς. Ακόμα και στο Ισραήλ σατυρίζεται ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΑ η κυβέρνηση, οι πράξεις της, ακόμα και &gt;&gt; @islandlayer και η παράλογη επέμβαση της θρησκείας στο κράτος. Διαφωνώ για την κατηγορία που αποδίδεις συλλήβδην στα δυτικα ΜΜΕ @janetravers It came moments after perfectly respectful interaction, so the juxtaposition was discomforting. @janetravers I have no idea why you felt the need to tweet that to all your followers rather than simply reply to me. @islandlayer μπορούμε να σατυρίσουμε ελεύθερα τον Γιαχβέ και κανείς ΔΕΝ ΘΑ ΜΑΣ ΣΚΟΤΩΣΕΙ. Τον Αλλάχ όμως; @islandlayer όχι βέβαια ότι φταίει σε κάτι η θρησκεία. Τα φανατικά καθάρματα φταίνει, όχι το Ισλάμ @SikanasGiorgos Έχω την βαθιά υποψία και σχεδόν βεβαιότητα πως τα δυτικά ΜΜΕ ΔΕΝ λειτουργούν ελεύθερα αλλά είναι μεγάλο θέμα για να το @SikanasGiorgos εξαντλήσουμε σε ένα σατυρικό ακάου. Ας πούμε η πλειοψηφία του ελληνικού τύπου εξυπηρετεί συμφέροντα @SikanasGiorgos Η θρησκεία όχι. Οι θρησκευτικοί ηγέτες όμως είναι καθάρματα @MariaLaoise as you said yourself, my conversation with you was perfectly respectful. Why are you so upset that I liked someone's tweet? @islandlayer ΣΥΜΦΩΝΩ. @MariaLaoise because Twitter is a large, inclusive, worldwide conversation and I like to get other points of view. I'd welcome others... @MariaLaoise ...to join this discussion, wouldn't you? @janetravers B/c I had to deal w/ nasty tweets last night (many of which were from ppl with whom I've never interacted). I am more than ... @janetravers ... willing to discuss w/ ppl who don't share my views (if only some liberals were so willing). I prefer those discussions ... @janetravers ... to be mutually respectful &amp; non-insulting. Favouriting that tweet seemed like an insult. @janetravers If they can rein in the childish name-calling, labelling and general unpleasantness. If I wanted to insult you, @MariaLaoise, I would do it directly, not by favouriting a tweet. This is getting frankly ridiculous. Are you... @MariaLaoise ...willing to get back to a discussion of free speech, or not? @janetravers Again, there was no need to tweet that to everyone. @MariaLaoise I don't agree with name-calling/personal insults. However I will pull no punches in terms of beliefs/ideology. Ideas=fair game. @janetravers Fighting the nun again? @janetravers I have to leave that discussion for now. I'm sure I'll return to it later. I hope for mature, civilised discussion. @MariaLaoise oh for crying out loud. This=ridiculous.Do you hope that criticising my Twitter behaviour I'll forget to discuss free speech? @MariaLaoise if you can act maturely, then bring it. All you've done this morning is plead insult where none exists. @vitaminsludge ;) @janetravers The discussion was about free speech. Let's stick to that. @janetravers I didn't follow up well-mannered interaction by favouriting a tweet calling you awful. Have I been awful to you? I don't ... @janetravers ... believe I have. I take ppl as I find them. I would prefer if you held off on thinking me awful until I tweet something ... @MariaLaoise you ask for maturity then behave like a child. I thought you didn't have time for a discussion on free speech? @janetravers ... that gives you cause to do so. @MariaLaoise I disagree with just about everything I've ever seen you tweet. However, I believe in free speech and have never insulted you. @MariaLaoise ...so I've had plenty of 'just cause' as you put it, but I won't belittle myself by insulting you personally. Now, free speech? @janetravers I'll don't have time to fully flesh out my position now. My basic point would be that one can defend freedom of speech ... @janetravers ... w/o celebrating speech that is problematic. Many Charlie cartoons fail into that category, IMO. @MariaLaoise define problematic?

Only the muslims take offence!!!! @JohnKerr2547 If Muslims have the decency to respect Jesus, then that same respect should be returned to Prophet Muhammad (SAW). @FadumoRali Look at ur own backyard,evry single forum is filled with hate for Jews..hw many killed till date?? @FadumoRali @SyrianNinjabi Mockery should not be made about anyone or anything. What if something dear to you was Mocked? @sugreev (1) So your blaming the entire 1.8 billion Muslims for what's occurring in Isreali/Palestine? @sugreev (2) It's Palestinians who are being mercilessly sputtered day in/day out @FadumoRali Are you trying to justify these terrible killings? I cant believe this. There was reason for murder @sugreev (3) Before Israeli, Jews and Muslims lived peacefully in many parts of the world @FadumoRali http://t.co/yDjWDxF01o Read the article.. u will no threis no peace with muslims (except a few)  if there is no blood in sight. @sugreev There are 1.8 billion Muslims, if only a ""few"" were peaceful I doubt this world would be the same. @FadumoRali muslims call Jews and Christians by names I dont wana repeat cause its too disgusting,so touch your own nose before accusing oth @FadumoRali ...of anything...and just as a side note the ones in the #parisattack were not jews they were islamic terrorists!! @kani_sasan Could already tell you're a bigot, rather not waste time. Btw that was used as an example to show double standards. @FadumoRali honey the thing is that they made fun of every religion and the only violent response came from Islam!!!! @kani_sasan No. If you Iooked at my recent post you'd see what that photo was referring to. @FadumoRali I am not a jew nor is anyone in my family but its just really unnecessary to drag jews into this issue in any way! @FadumoRali they have nothing to do with this issue!!! @FadumoRali 😩 hopeless...bye @FadumoRali I grew up in Europe and I know that all the religions there are treated equally! @FadumoRali like I said hopeless...bye!! @FadumoRali @sugreev The world is terror ridden &amp; even a wiki list of world terrorist organizations will tell you is behind the terror.

Let´s get serious about #CharlieHebdo and West's double standards on freedom of speech! http://t.co/g5wR4TnstL,"@LatuffCartoons no, a cartoon of mohammed is synonymous with a cartoon of Jesus or something like that... not the holocaust... :) @Rocky_the__Rock Aha, I see...some issues are protected by freedom of speech, others not...hmmm...double standard at best! @LatuffCartoons @QueridaPaulita I don't think that's a like-to-like comparison but agree with the sentiment of hypocrisy. @LatuffCartoons One is poking fun at religious zealots and the other at the death of millions. The big difference needs explaining to you? @Thinkerist Sure, double standard, some issues are protected by freedom of speech, others arent @LatuffCartoons no, you can publish a cartoon of the holocaust if you want, but it's abhorrent... a cartoon of Mohammed is no big deal... :) @LatuffCartoons but there are restrictions on freedom of speech, eg. hate speech :) @LatuffCartoons The line always has to be drawn somewhere but that doesn't necessarily imply double standards - just a limit. .@LatuffCartoons @herwinthole you know, holocaust is not a religion or fictional character. 

Ah well, nevermind. @latuffcartoons @herwinthole That's a huge difference of subject. Cartoons of one fake person or cartoons of a massacre @LatuffCartoons @IsinElicin killing millions of people for their race&amp;religion is no equal to mockking a prophet. @visualeditor_nl @herwinthole I see, one issue deserve freedom of speech the other don't...double standard yeah! @eagunes @IsinElicin Well, if we are talking about freedom of speech, there are no red lines, we can mock EVERYTHING @LatuffCartoons @eva_n_agnosti ""Μπράβο"" για το RT. Από την χθεσινή τραγωδία εσύ αυτό κατάλαβες; Να υποθέσω είσαι έτοιμη να ανάψεις φούρνους @LatuffCartoons @IsinElicin acc to human rights law, actually there are red lines of freedom of expression: defamation, threat, hate speech. @LatuffCartoons @IsinElicin criticizing religion is no hate speech. preventive tweet :) @eagunes @IsinElicin Freedom of speech, the real one, has no red lines, sorry @eagunes @LatuffCartoons erdem there could be legal consequences regarding your point, and one can risk it in the name of freedom+ @LatuffCartoons Live and Let Live. @LatuffCartoons @IsinElicin says a cartoonist. and I respect that but I will stick to ECHR verdicts.

Or anything, going by your tweets. @galaxyarchis Αν παρατηρήσεις αναφέρετε σε Ολοκαύτωμα (6Μ νεκροί) οχι Εβραίους η YHV.Άτυχες. @SikanasGiorgos @LatuffCartoons @eva_n_agnosti @amsterdamtrader @LatuffCartoons @herwinthole dont agree. One should be able to make jokes about holocaust. I think that is repulsive, sick @amsterdamtrader @LatuffCartoons @herwinthole unnecessary, not funny and distastefull but still. Free speech above all @amsterdamtrader @LatuffCartoons @herwinthole as long as you dont ask for another holocaust/violence. @LatuffCartoons @Thinkerist You'd be on to something if sometime later today group of armed Jews raided this cartoonist's house &amp; shot him. In countries with free speech, we don't kill you for either one. @ThirdCultureFam @LatuffCartoons @QueridaPaulita Holocaust cartoons are protected expression in the US. HTH. @LatuffCartoons @Thinkerist @LatuffCartoons @eagunes @IsinElicin No, no and no...one is a fictitious ""god"", the other is the torture &amp; death of millions, try thinking. @Rocky_the__Rock @LatuffCartoons a cartoon mocking holocaust/Jews in general will get you fired &amp; possibly jail tho.😒but not mocking muslims @Rocky_the__Rock @LatuffCartoons .. Doesn't...mocking a minority group which is already oppressed in that society is easy &amp; acceptable @amsterdamtrader @LatuffCartoons @herwinthole that mag mocked the girls captured by Boko haram. Making them look like savages to make a joke @amsterdamtrader @LatuffCartoons @herwinthole would same mag ever use holocaust to make a joke... NO 😒😒 @IainSomers @herwinthole that magazine mocked those innocent girls taken by Biko haram to make a joke about welfare .. @MissyDazz @herwinthole which is imo absolutely allowed. And though sick it maybe also draws attention to it. Didnt see the cartoon though @IainSomers @herwinthole do u think they would ever use a holocaust joke to make a point "" draw attention"" ?? @MissyDazz @herwinthole depends for what. But thats not my point anyway. I dont say i like/enjoy these pics. Just that it is and 1/2 @MissyDazz @herwinthole should be allowed. As long as it doesnt call for violence. @MissyDazz @herwinthole do u have a link to the mentioned cartoon? @IainSomers @herwinthole at end of day #CharlieHebdo shouldn't be praised &amp; looked at as a beacon for free speech... http://t.co/WpGnrWEMdS @IainSomers @herwinthole when their free speech is so selective... @MissyDazz  how do you think Muslims are 'oppressed' in the west...? :) @Rocky_the__Rock I'm not sure if u kno any Muslims but ask any one of them.Living in the west is great n I'm thankful but its not easy... @MissyDazz yes, idiots on public transport etc can be abusive... but it's not classified as 'oppression'... u could call it discrimination @Rocky_the__Rock the "" discrimination"" goes way beyond public transport that's why I call it oppression esp when mainstream media (fox) ... @Rocky_the__Rock is targeting everyday Muslims by saying they are no different than the terrorists who kill.. @MissyDazz Fox news say a lot of stupid things... :) @MissyDazz have you ever considered giving your life to Jesus...? :) @Rocky_the__Rock well they have a huge ass audience, n when u add bill Mahar's audience.. that's pretty much all of America hating Muslims @Rocky_the__Rock thus justifying any attack on Muslims moderate or not @MissyDazz all the muslims I have met, and there aren't very many, have all been friendly... it's the ones on tv that are not very nice :) @Rocky_the__Rock unfortunately many have only heard of the ones on TV @Rocky_the__Rock I love jesus (PBUH) as much as any other prophet in Islam @MissyDazz Jesus died for everyone, if you put your faith in him, he will forgive your sins... :) @MissyDazz @herwinthole the right to free speach is not an obligation to think/speak about everything @MissyDazz @herwinthole not funny indeed. Not at all.  But dont see a problem why not to publish apart from commercial reasons. @MarshallArts7 @LatuffCartoons @QueridaPaulita No, only if you are black &amp; wearing a hoodie.

The Earth without Art is just 'Eh'. #streetart #JeSuisCharlie http://t.co/72XpFM2kOn,"@charliesaidthat @inthecompanyof Unfortunately, for some murderers, the ""earth"" without ""art"" leaves just ""He"". Which is the problem. @charliesaidthat Your name is all over Twitter. @GaryDayEllison It feels like it. @charliesaidthat I actually saw your status saying #JeSuisCharlie before the news and wondered why you're saying you're Charlie in French... @charliesaidthat You said it. “@charliesaidthat: The Earth without Art is just 'Eh'. #streetart #JeSuisCharlie http://t.co/qvFOam85RJ” love this @charliesaidthat Rightly said! All the art lovers out there would surely agree with it. #BeInteresting #Streetart @JesseCEEEE @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat ...so pay for art as you would expect to pay for food. Artists need to eat too. @DeanPHanley @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat so I do ?! @JesseCEEEE @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat So many people pirate nowdays, and call it ""sharing"". @DeanPHanley @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat yes they do @DeanPHanley @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat that's why u shouldn't put shit up that u don't want to share @JesseCEEEE @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat But if you put it in a box and don't let anyone see it ever, you never sell anything. @JesseCEEEE @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat A shop puts it's products in a window, as advertising, not as an invitation to steal. @JesseCEEEE @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat If someone breaks the glass to get it, that person is a thief, not a customer. @DeanPHanley @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat yes that's why u have stuff u put on the net to be over exposed and collections u display n sell? @JesseCEEEE @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat I like Julian's work, if I were to print one of his pieces, frame and hang it, I break the glass. @DeanPHanley @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat what if the person takes a photo of it and posts it @DeanPHanley @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat it's not the same as actually stealing the object @JesseCEEEE @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat Jessica, It must be sheer heaven being married to you. (sarcasm) @JesseCEEEE @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat It is steeling intellectual property you apologistic cow, &amp; a violation of copyright law. @DeanPHanley @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat yes that's why self respecting art respecting people won't do it but that's the chance u take @DeanPHanley @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat putting shit online @DeanPHanley @JesseCEEEE @QuayeJulian a photo has it's own copyright, immaterial of the subject.#justsaying “@DeanPHanley: @JesseCEEEE @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat Jessica, It must be sheer heaven being married to you.

Why moooooooooo @DeanPHanley @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat no need for the hate if u don't want ur shit stolen copy right it print ur logo across it @JesseCEEEE @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat At least you acknowledge that you are a cow. @JesseCEEEE @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat Everything is signed, dated and marked copyright. That is all that I need, to sue a thief. @DeanPHanley @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat are you short or something is this why your picking on me mooooooooooo @DeanPHanley @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat do u acknowledge that u have a small penis and are a angry lil man @JesseCEEEE @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat Worst case of Mad Cow Disease I've ever seen. @DeanPHanley @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat ok great there you go sue away why am I being targeted by u in this rant @DeanPHanley @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat moooooooooooooooo hold up lemme steal some of your art ok bye @DeanPHanley @QuayeJulian @charliesaidthat why are you so angry @JesseCEEEE @DeanPHanley @QuayeJulian Wowser. You can omit me from further shouting at the interwebs please. ;) @charliesaidthat @DeanPHanley @QuayeJulian who are you ppl I didn't steal any of yo dam ugly art ppl don't buy of ya'll coz of ur attitude @charliesaidthat @JesseCEEEE @QuayeJulian My apologies, She was blocked and reported the moment she threatened to steal my work. @charliesaidthat @JesseCEEEE @QuayeJulian I suggest other artists do the same. @charliesaidthat That may be if an artwork is included, incidentally, in a photo, however unauthorized reproduction is a federal offense. @charliesaidthat By incidentally, I mean, by example, if it is hanging on a wall behind someone taking a selfie. @charliesaidthat @JesseCEEEE @QuayeJulian If said photo were isolated from context of the selfie, and reproduced, per se, that would be --- @charliesaidthat --- a violation of copyright law. All this is codified in detail. You may need to protect your own work someday. I hope not @DeanPHanley Ah you are talking US copyright law. I know about UK copyright law - and law is seemingly quite different then. @charliesaidthat Still, International treaty obligations demand that US law, and British law, be mutually respected. @charliesaidthat And again, I apologize for any distress that I may have inadvertently caused you. @charliesaidthat On the other hand, description of the method Jack the ripper used to subdue his victims, is considered property of the ... @charliesaidthat Times of London. This is something we yanks consider very odd. To us, news is public domain, but we still have to respect @charliesaidthat British copyright law. @charliesaidthat Canaletto's paintings are consicered by US law to be old enough for public domain, however, if I were to reproduce @charliesaidthat  Canaletto from King George's collection, I would have to obtain permission from Her Royal Majesty, Queen Elizabeth,and @charliesaidthat attach a notification, to the image stating that I had done so.",non-rumours

Here u go @asimm_uk http://t.co/MGRy8SxAbR It's acknowledged in the hadith that he did this @GarethTownsend9 @OwenJones84 @sportyone11 @garethtownsend9 @owenjones84 hahaha…first of all this has been forwarded to a scholar.. @sportyone11 @garethtownsend9 @owenjones84 …whom comparing it to the arabic has cleared that the translation is rough..once an accurate So are you telling me that Mohammad categorically DIDN'T do this? @asimm_uk @GarethTownsend9 @OwenJones84 @sportyone11 @garethtownsend9 @owenjones84 i get clear answer will glad to post it..or if you are a sincere christian out for truth..speak This is why #ISIS behead- it is in the tradition of what their leader Mohammad did. @asimm_uk @GarethTownsend9 @OwenJones84 @sportyone11 @garethtownsend9 @owenjones84 as i stated..im NOT a scholar..so speak to a scholar and tell me what he says @sportyone11 @asimm_uk @OwenJones84 ISIS may also have been mislead by a misinterpretation of the text Please @asimm_uk @GarethTownsend9 @OwenJones84 @sportyone11 @garethtownsend9 @owenjones84 yes the fools read the same thing you do..approx 126 scholars have written to baghdadi proving Not so.

Never quote Wiki to back you opinion/argument, it lets you down. @InfoBears @SandieBlickem @OwenJones84 https://t.co/3WXzlTKbGb in this case it is correct. I know the history you don't. Read. @InfoBears @SandieBlickem @OwenJones84 you might learn something. @InfoBears @SandieBlickem @OwenJones84 between 16th &amp; 19th Fulani Muslims conquered and enslaved most of central Africa. @AudioFidget From my very limited knowledge of Fulani. Did they not originate in N Africa? @InfoBears a number of areas including North African Berbers. They waged Islamic jihad across North and Central Africa conquering&amp;enslaving @InfoBears they were the main supplier of slaves to the Atlantic slave trade. @InfoBears with the Barbary States (Ottoman-Muslim)in the north enslaving around 1.5million Europeans into slavery. @audiofidget Hs been evr thus throughout history all ovr world. Invasion, pillage,rape,slavery,exploitation in name of power/profit/religion @Desiminn @MelRJ @OwenJones84 They seem to love it when there's a terrorist attack tbh, @LuchadoreMierda @MelRJ @OwenJones84 It feeds the hate. @InfoBears right so your original point about Islamic countries minding their own business is clearly wrong right? :-) @audiofidget It is pointless going back centuries. I was referring to more recent 20th century in Middle East. Civilisations rise &amp; fall. @InfoBears I gave you examples throught the era @InfoBears jordan, Egypt and Syria attacked Israel, Saddam invaded Iran, gassed the Kurds and massacred 500k of his own people. @InfoBears Saddam attacked invaded Kuwait. @InfoBears I mean have you ever read the history of Africa and the Middle East? It's one big violent war from beginning to end. @InfoBears then you have the Taliban in afghan, Islamists in North west China, Chechnya. @audiofidget It's the history of the world!! Invasions, wars, land and mineral stealing, genocide. ""Christian""  or Muslim invaders the same. @audiofidget What about ""Christians"" land stealing and genocide of Native Americans.""Christian"" Germans genocide of Jews, Roma? @audiofidget The West armed him! Then West/corporate interests took over.Hand of US in every modern war. War makes money for the powerful. @InfoBears the Russians armed him. 85% of iraq's weapons came from Russia. @arembooks @stephen501 @OwenJones84 Satire is aimed at the powerful, not the voiceless.

Horrendous story from Paris - 11 shot dead + many wounded at offices of satirical mag #CharlieHebdo that published cartoons of Muhammad.,"@piersmorgan gun control at work. @piersmorgan they also go after druglords and gangsters, do you have any actual evidence that they are even linked yet? thought not. @piersmorgan Racial Islam is getting out of control. @piersmorgan  follow me please @piersmorgan religion of peace @piersmorgan once again the religion of peace rears it's ugly head. you don't see jews or catholics murdering people for making jokes @piersmorgan and anti-semitic, @piersmorgan obviously they don't at all deserve to be killed but why would you take the risk of a reaction with a cartoon like that? @Sports_Politic @piersmorgan More like Islam at work. @piersmorgan fuck off. that's not about islam @ljnicholls74 been to Northern Ireland lately? @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan racial is depicting someone a particular religion hold dear in a idiotic way @1JusticeHipHop @piersmorgan who really gives a fuck? It could be the prophet Dave for all I care, point is people have been killed. Twonk. @liberal_leftie when was the last time an IRA member executed loads of kids in a school because they were learning? @Mohameddahir12 @piersmorgan Free speech gives people the right to do so. @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan always an excuse. @piersmorgan ; thats just horrible.this is not the way to honour our prophet who was a man who advocated peace amongst man. @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan free speech also must be cautious of tolerance, free speech  doesn't give the right to insult other religions @Sports_Politic @piersmorgan If you think guns are the reason, you are a fool. The culprit is Islam. @SkippyJay97 @piersmorgan because of freedom @ljnicholls74 I don't know, they were probably too busy planting nailbombs in pubs and cars or executing police answering 999 calls. @abdel6301 @piersmorgan I do agree but it's your people throwing tantrums because your feelings got hurt. Live with it or fuck off. @ljnicholls74 although speaking of killing kids. http://t.co/GldcA1j1mz ring any bells? So enough of the holier than though bullshit thanks. @Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan free speech by definition does @Firstborn87 @piersmorgan Who married a 6 year old and raped her at 9. @ljnicholls74 the people who attacked that building, even IF they are Muslim, no more represent their faith than the IRA do Catholics @Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan Yes it does. Mockery is important, ridiculing daft beliefs is important. @Sjcrookston @AidanRoyale   religion is an extremely delicate subject. Its belief and a lifestyle. Insult that and you make enemies @Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale extremely delicate for you. Everyone else doesn't have to adhere to how you feel @BRANNAN88 @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan  well not everyone one thinks like you do in the west.  The whole world isn't in the west @Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston Just because it is a delicate subject does not mean that it should be ignored. @Mohameddahir12 @BRANNAN88 @piersmorgan Guess what? France is in the West. @Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan Well here, I respect people but not their beliefs if they don't warrant respect. Simple. @Sjcrookston @AidanRoyale  nobody is forcing you to be like us. You don't have to respect us BUT BE TOLERANT OF US!!! @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan no we see worse ... Remember the Norwegian catholics who killed about 100 in a youths camp ? He was labelled 1/2 @AidanRoyale @BRANNAN88 @piersmorgan yes it is. West isn't necessarily a geographical region @Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston If you want to be tolerated, learn to tolerate gays, women, Jews, and Christians. @Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale says who? We aren't out killing people. Is that more noble than printing a picture? @BRANNAN88 @AidanRoyale  I wouldn't go out of my means to insult Christianity.  I've get better things to do. This pple had an ""agenda"" @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan as a psychopath... But if they are even muslims who might have dont it, they are extremist and terrorist !! @AidanRoyale @Sjcrookston I'm respectful of all people irrespective of sexual orientation,  religion,  and race @Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan Just accept people you will get your feelings and 'prophet' trodden upon.. Doesn't mean you get.. @Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston But your religion is not @Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan to throw tantrums and murder innocent people..if you were so comfortable in your religious faith.. @Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan You wouldn't care what anyone says about Islam. Simple. @ljnicholls74 @liberal_leftie in the US this is carried every couple of month !! But they are catholics and so they're sick and nt terrorist @Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale An Agenda? In comic satire? People poke fun at all religions, you just can't take it because it's yours. @mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan don't misunderstand me.NOT all muslims are terrorists. but at the moment all terrorists seem to be muslims @ljnicholls74 oops. Israel? Northern Ireland? @Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale Id challenge Islam because it is a violent religion in its most basic form. Same with Christianity. @Mohameddahir12 @BRANNAN88 That agenda being Islam. @Sjcrookston @AidanRoyale  I think at your age you know that western media has got an agenda muslims @Sjcrookston @AidanRoyale religion and individuals are separate entities @mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan he was a lunatic. isis is a group that target vulnerable people because they can't fight back @Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale they need more of an agenda. #religionofpeace @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan thats bcz the media labels any attack carried out by muslims as a terrorist attack !! But any attacker who isnt @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan is considered a sick person !! In the us school shootings and cop killings happens every couple of months but bcz @Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston The media in our countries does whatever means necessary to protect Islam from criticism. @AidanRoyale @Sjcrookston I doubt you've read on islam or read the Quran. Making accusations on things you don't know about is ignorance @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan they r nt carried out by muslims ... They r nt terrorist attacks !! @Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston Exactly, which is why I do not tolerate your religion. @Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston Why do so many verses call for death? @mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan once again they are lunatics who don't quote 'god is great' @AidanRoyale @Sjcrookston evidence? @mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan look at there targets. beslan. school in pakistan ,river of blood in syria, kidnapping of young girls in nigeria @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan but do u consider them as terrorists ?? @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan why dont u consider isis as lunatics bcz they are !! @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan i know all their crimes ... Is it really different from mass murdering children at a youths camp ?? @mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan BECAUSE THEY HAVE STATED IT IS FOR A NEW ISLAMIC STATE!!! like i said, i know not all muslims are murderers @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan all people who commit acts that terrorizes should be called terrorist and nt only the muslim ones @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan we are arguing about 2 different points @mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan NO!! but most of those are condemned . the likes of ISIS seem to get more recruits every day .is that right? @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan i am a muslim and i know isis are terrorist and i cant and neither cant my religion explain their action @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan but what i am saying is that other people who arent muslims who commit act of terrorism such as killing kids @mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan i agree. IRA ,boko haram,taliban, ISIS, neo nazis are all classes of terrorists. @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan and what do you think about these recruits ?? Who are they ?? Arent they the irakis who were bombarded and their @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan families killed by the US for some oil ?? Aremt they Afghanistan people who had millions of their countrymen @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan and although i hate to admit ... But u r partially correct ... Unfortunately a big part of the terrorist attacks @mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan people are joining ISIS and invading a muslim country, murdering women +kids yet blame the west. no difference @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan are carried out by muslims but they radicalized after western attacks on their homes and families @mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan but the middle east has always been at war with itself. my question is why can't people just accept each other? @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan i dont blame the west and i certainly dont excuse their actions as terrorists but i might understand their @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan radicalization @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan at war with itself ?? How is that ?? @BRANNAN88 @piersmorgan : Whatever makes you makes you  happy. Thank god I live in South Africa and not the UK. Muslims here live in peace @ljnicholls74 look at your own country's history and you'll see how sill you sound @ohffsman so whatever happened to evolution? are we still stuck in the dark ages? why can't people accept not everyone is the same? @ljnicholls74 who's we, the dark ages is a period of time specific to Europe only, you know? @ljnicholls74 you reply makes no sense whatsoever wth? @liberal_leftie @ljnicholls74 The IRA wasn't fighting for Jesus. @Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @Sjcrookston A religion that instructs the murder of any follower that chooses to leave it is obviously evil. @Pablo_1791 @ljnicholls74 no, they were fighting 'for' the Pope against the British Crown, in their eyes anyway. @Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @Sjcrookston Islam should be forbidden in the west as it's an ideology incompatible with our beliefs. @liberal_leftie @Pablo_1791 this is the 21st century. are human beings not evolving at all? are we still sacages who'd rather kill than live @liberal_leftie @ljnicholls74 Where did you learn that foolishness? I do hope you didn't pay for it. It wasn't the Irish Papal Army. #derp @ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 yes, in short we are exactly that. People are murdered and beaten every day that doesn't make headline news. @ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 and the only thing evolving is our means to carry out those same attacks. @liberal_leftie @Pablo_1791 should we ignore the poor innocents in syria just so we don't harm any of the ISIS 'volunteers' ? @Pablo_1791 @ljnicholls74 no, it wasn't,  but as far as many people were concerned it might as well have been. Much like al qaida belive. @ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 no.  I supported action in Syria as it happens @liberal_leftie @Pablo_1791 most wars are started by a maniac who uses religion as their motive . @ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 absolutely. The problem we have though is others attacking all Muslims or Catholics or Jews because of a minority @ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 would be like me attacking all tv presenters because of the actions of Jimmy Saville @ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 and like you say, most people involved in things like this are maniacs, religion is just a convenient excuse. @liberal_leftie @ljnicholls74 You're speaking ahistorical gibberish. Oh, btw: ""We have avenged the prophet!"" https://t.co/avkL632xIs @liberal_leftie @ljnicholls74 Your analogy would be apt if this were one attack by one person and not a long, wide pattern of jihad. @AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 what about Israel? @Laurence0802 @AFC_Harry34 what about israel? do they target women and children because they don't agree to a certain way? @ljnicholls74 @Laurence0802 they target women and children because they don't want them on land they believe is theirs, but isn't. @ljnicholls74 @AFC_Harry34 I agree! I go to Israel 3 times a year! Massively the innocent party! That was a rhetorical question @AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 Bullshit. Wake up. Read up or shut up. Hamas Fatah Hezbollah amongst others want Israel wiped off the map #terror @AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 honestly Harry. You are embarrassing yourself. Media swayed. Read up the factual historical background. @AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 easier to support a perceived underdog. Forget that before Israel fired a bullet 10k rockets were fired @ israel! @Laurence0802 @ljnicholls74 #saysitall http://t.co/SdnpjlPW42 @AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 no actually it doesn't!!!!!!! Wake up. @AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 look at land records. Read the mandates. The UN resolutions. Anyone can knock up a pretty graphic. @Pablo_1791 @ljnicholls74 jimmy Saville wasn't alone in his actions either, so my analogy is sound. @liberal_leftie @ljnicholls74 Ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous. @mdluk199 @Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston Much agreed. @mostafaihab96 @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan Have you ever heard of Timothy McVeigh? He was called a domestic terrorist! @Sports_Politic @piersmorgan That's hilarious. This type of thing happens once every 20 years in France. Twice a year in the USA! @Fletch_Butcher @piersmorgan nothing hilarious about people getting killed. You are a disgrace. @acb4values @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan seriously ?? U r gonna jump on a single exception ?? @mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan Olympic park bombing, weather underground, Sikh Temple shooting, etc., were all listed as terrorist acts! @acb4values @piersmorgan by whom ?? The government or the media and the people @mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan Some media, but all by the government. With this President many Muslim shootings haven't been called terrorism! @acb4values @piersmorgan i dont care about the govt !! The federal govt acknowledged that only 6% of attacks were carried out by muslims @acb4values @piersmorgan the point of difference was that if a muslim commits a crime most probably will be considered as a terrorist @acb4values @piersmorgan however if a person committing the same crime is NOT muslim most probably will be considered sick psycho @mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan That's because they haven't labeled all attacks by Muslims as terrorist acts! @acb4values @piersmorgan and i think this only started after 9-11 ... Not after mcveigh !! And that the media is to blame !! @mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan 2 Muslim attacks on military bases were called work place violence!! That's STUPID!! @acb4values @piersmorgan but the majority !! Even you have to admit that the media is biased about this !! @mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan After we saw the thousands of Muslims rejoicing in the streets at the murders!! @acb4values what do they call christian attacks on schools ?? Just like the one carried out by taliban ?? @mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan Many attacks on our embassies and other embassies, 1st twin tower attack, USS Cole, but 9-11 final straw!! @acb4values and millions of them condemning such violence !! @acb4values how about we work the other way around two @acb4values lets consider the US attacks on foreign soil !! Lets consider the foreign invasions !! Irak afghanistan ... @mostafaihab96 What Christian attacks on schools? Where? Were they yelling Jesus is Great while they were doing it? @acb4values i am sorry but how many innocent american was killed during all those attacks ?? Just a fraction of the innocents killed during @acb4values the invasion of irak or afghanistan !! But you wont consider these innocent muslim people who were bombarded by your military !! @acb4values i ddnt see the boston bomber yelling any religious words !! @acb4values look ... Killers and psychos and from everywhere and every culture and every religion !! @acb4values but one thing we can agree on is that the western media is biased against muslims !! And consequently so are western people!! @mostafaihab96 Where are the hundreds of Christians rioting and killing for the defilement of Christ? @acb4values why would they ?? As i believe they take this event proudly !! @mostafaihab96 That's funny!! They were cowards that put bombs by children and walked away quietly!! @acb4values however in islam we dont depict our prophet ... If you would like to mention our prophet then at least respect our religion @mostafaihab96 So after making an accusation you should back up with evidence of Christian attacks on schools!! @acb4values just like the coward person who shot and killed kids in cold-blood at schools @acb4values not only at schools !! There are loads of examples !! The IRA the Norwegian attacker who killed 86 in a youth camp @acb4values but u r from the US and the school shootings are the most things i thought you would relate to @mostafaihab96 The real question is where have you ever seen thousands of Christians rejoicing for the killing of innocence? @acb4values but it was never my intention to make accusations. I am merely demonstrating that psychos who kills people are everywhere @acb4values and not only muslims @mostafaihab96 This is true, but there are millions of Muslims that condone this and rejoice at the killings!! @acb4values not millions !! These are only a few who were fed lies there entire lives !! @acb4values it happened before with christians with religious white groups who killed black people and celebrated it !! @acb4values but now these groups have almost vanished and i believe this will happen to the few extremists !! And they r few compared @acb4values to all the muslims in the world who believe in the religion of peace just like me !! Or do you think i am a terrorist ?? @mostafaihab96 Actually, I would NEVER agree with that! They rarely even mention that it was a muslim attack, especially regarding Israel! @acb4values i am just happy we agree on the same concepts !! Perhaps i am too pessimistic!! But when it comes to muslims i have seen it all @mostafaihab96 Most of MSM placates to Muslim extremist! Even this they're calling Islamaphobia, when phobia is irrational fear! @acb4values some are really rational just like yourself whom i enjoy talking to learning how people look at us (muslims) trying to improve! @mostafaihab96 IT'S NOT irrational fear when they actually kill you for satire and being an ""infidel""! @acb4values but unfortunately there are also a few who would just insult me and would want to kill me !! Either way my response is the same @mostafaihab96 I appreciate that, but you do need to know that acting at all like this was justified doesn't help. You seem reasonable too! @mostafaihab96 We could have more world peace if we sought to understand each other better. @acb4values its not justified and can never be explained and i am sorry if i gave you this impression !! Perhaps it was a misinterpretation @mostafaihab96 I do know that there are peaceful Muslims, but not sure if Islam is a religion of peace. None of history shows that to be.",rumours

It states violence against Jews and others is fine. @YAYshamsaldeen @Aristotleslogic @BBCBreaking @Jonteinspain Almost all world conflicts current involve muslims - guess it's coincidence @Aristotleslogic @BBCBreaking @Jonteinspain simply, how do u know the reason is true and not made-up, especially with nowadays ISIS prob(2) @YAYshamsaldeen @Aristotleslogic @BBCBreaking You are an idiot go away. We´ve had enough of Muslim violence and murder @Aristotleslogic @YAYshamsaldeen @BBCBreaking Fuck off you foul shit. @fatclyde @BBCBreaking @janeikelboom No thats not true. Quran says, respect jews and christians @YAYshamsaldeen @ElContador2000 @BBCBreaking @Jonteinspain it seems you're defending the terrorist attack, and condemning us. Typical. @fatclyde @BBCBreaking @janeikelboom omg, well we dont get anywhere with this conversation @Aristotleslogic @BBCBreaking @Jonteinspain finally, there are more than 1bn muslims in the world (go and learn statistics) or i can teach u @Aristotleslogic @YAYshamsaldeen @ElContador2000 @BBCBreaking You´re mad. I absolutely condemn the attack and those who did it. @Aristotleslogic @YAYshamsaldeen @ElContador2000 @BBCBreaking Not only do we have the dead to worry about but their families. Its outrageous @Jonteinspain @YAYshamsaldeen @ElContador2000 @BBCBreaking Not you, I was talking to yayshamsaldeen @YAYshamsaldeen @BBCBreaking @Jonteinspain Boko Haram, ISIS, Al Qaeda, etc, taught me all I need to know about your religion. @SecularFraud @BBCBreaking So terrorism didn't/doesn't exist outside of Islam? @ClearSeer @SecularFraud @BBCBreaking Act by doing what? @nadadictator @BBCBreaking @janeikelboom Here you go..http://t.co/ybS5SnJr64
Plenty more in Quran if you want to enlighten yourself. @Aristotleslogic @ElContador2000 @BBCBreaking @Jonteinspain go back to my 1st comment and u will understand my main point (1) @Aristotleslogic @BBCBreaking @Jonteinspain dear whoever, ISIS are attacking muslim countries too, just a simple example. @Jonteinspain @YAYshamsaldeen Islamists were responsible. Most of their victims globally are Muslims. Turkeys don't vote for Christmas. @Jonteinspain @Aristotleslogic @ElContador2000 @BBCBreaking Now u r escaping from offending muslims to condemning the attack. @Jonteinspain @YAYshamsaldeen @ElContador2000 @BBCBreaking sorry John, I thought I replied to yayshamsaldeen. Must've hit the wrong one. @Jonteinspain @Aristotleslogic @BBCBreaking comparably, just imagine if I claimed that all anti-islam are degenerates😊 @YAYshamsaldeen @Jonteinspain @Aristotleslogic @BBCBreaking At this moment I doubt anyone could give a shit about offending muslims @ElContador2000 @Jonteinspain @Aristotleslogic @BBCBreaking offending muslims is not offense 😊 bcos the media has done enough offending them @YAYshamsaldeen الله يعينك ..من تحاول تقنع .مهما حاولنا نظهر صورة الإسلام الحقيقيه..لازم حد يشوهها  م @YAYshamsaldeen @Jonteinspain @Aristotleslogic @BBCBreaking Victim mentality, sod off somewhere where they have Sharia law @ElContador2000 @YAYshamsaldeen @Aristotleslogic @BBCBreaking Here here but anywhere other than Britain. @fatclyde @BBCBreaking @janeikelboom Dont bother. I know quran. Probably more then you. My advice for u is. Read talmud. Thats a sick book @YAYshamsaldeen @BBCBreaking  very appropriate answer @richardpentney @BBCBreaking Ya that will fix the problem @YAYshamsaldeen @Aristotleslogic @ElContador2000 @BBCBreaking At this moment do you think anyone gives a shit @Jonteinspain @YAYshamsaldeen @ElContador2000 @BBCBreaking http://t.co/pau7DG3gq0 @nadadictator @BBCBreaking @janeikelboom You know nothing. The moderate muslims are those that deviate from the original. @nadadictator @BBCBreaking @janeikelboom People like you are the root of the problem. You defend murder and atrocities and blame others @fatclyde @BBCBreaking @janeikelboom I know nothing?? Please read the talmud, then come back with comments pls @fatclyde @BBCBreaking @janeikelboom Thank you for insulting me. Again, read the talmud!!!! @nadadictator @fatclyde @BBCBreaking can you please remove me from this discussion #thanks @janeikelboom @fatclyde @BBCBreaking Why? U cant handle the truth? READ TALMUD!!!! Then u know which book is sick!!! And who it belongs to. @YAYshamsaldeen @BBCBreaking I'm sure they are not belong to any religion or may be they are some retarded person, isn't ? #HolyCrap @MelRJ @SecularFraud @BBCBreaking Limiting mass immigration by backward fascistic peasants with fantasy friends, who hate freedom. @MelRJ @SecularFraud @BBCBreaking And if you're looking for a fight, look elsewhere &amp; grow up, not everyone obsessed with Harry Potter. @MelRJ @SecularFraud @BBCBreaking Not everyone seeing dangers of mass migration is rightwing. I was fighting racism before you were a sperm. @MelRJ @SecularFraud @BBCBreaking Anyone posing with that silly mask is a juvenile armchair warrior. I fought on the streets. @emirevoke @BBCBreaking thanks Dr. @Umlujain4 اهم شي في التجاوب برود الاعصاب و دماثة الخلق والله يعين @ClearSeer @SecularFraud How would that prevent anyone (or any ethnicity) from being radicalised by say, downloading extreme material? @ClearSeer @SecularFraud And the majority of Muslims in the West were either born here or came here FOR freedom. Collective blame is wrong. @ClearSeer 1 You don't know me, 2 Never said anything about right/left wing, 3 it's not about immigration it's about the ease with which... @ClearSeer ...any1 of any background can be radicalised by extremists intent on spreading hate. Mass immigration happened to the Americas... @ClearSeer ...to Australasia. What Europe has in comparison is not even close, &amp; most migrants are law abiding &amp; contribute positively. @braemar88 @BBCBreaking sends a message @ClearSeer This collective blame on all Muslims or all immigrants for the criminal few IS bigoted. Deal w/ the ACTUAL perp, not all who... @ClearSeer ...happen to have the same religion, ethnicity, nationality or skin colour. @MelRJ @SecularFraud How come you want to speak to me but block me from replying?&gt; A true believer in free speech, aintcha. Too complex 4U. @MelRJ @SecularFraud &amp; they have remained in multicultural ghettoes &amp; not integrated. Apartheid, I blame political class who created it. @MelRJ @SecularFraud And you're wrong about most born here, they're still pouring in from Pakistan, tribals in a modern secular society. @MelRJ 1. No, you're anonymous! 2. No, but your intro page does. 3. It's ALL about immigration; 5 million in France alone. Germany 2, all EU @MelRJ So many really don't understand the concept of free speech. Immediately blocking anyone who disagrees with them, or worse, criticises @MelRJ @SecularFraud Who mentioned ethnicity? You. I think you're a muslim hiding your identity and pretending yo're broad minded. @richardpentney @BBCBreaking No it doesn't. Just shows we are as barbaric as they are @braemar88 @BBCBreaking well what exactly do you propose? Diplomacy, harsh language, a slap on the wrist? @Kool_K not they all but only one. Do you know how many of us do not bother strict orders of Almighty Allah and his prophoet (PBHU) that... @Kool_K .... not to kill innocent in any circumstances.",rumours

What exactly is your point? I will have fun proving your ignorance @HA45z My point, is you can't say a blatant verse stating to ""kill them wherever you find them"" (US, EU, ME) is taken out of context... @StDxCorrosive yes I can because you still don't understand judging by how you still take things out of context. http://t.co/7vbTSJRds4 @StDxCorrosive read the article. I'm pretty sure you'll still be ignorant even when you see the truth but I guess thats not my problem @HA45z @StDxCorrosive I suppose it really means sit down and talk to unbelievers about what it means to serve Allah? If you don't like my @HA45z @StDxCorrosive opinion on the subject. By all means, block me account so you don't have to see it. @StDxCorrosive your opinion is fine, the ignorance not so much. If you read the article you'd understand the context and why it was said @HA45z @StDxCorrosive So he replaces the word ""them"" with ""idolaters"" and that makes it okay? Yes the bible said kill idolaters but @HA45z @StDxCorrosive only he without sin can cast the first stone. @HA45z @StDxCorrosive and I'm pretty sure it wasn't God who said that it was man. @StDxCorrosive you still havent caught on. At the time Muhammed and followers were being tortured and constantly attacked. @StDxCorrosive defending themselves seems pretty rational and justified, wouldnt you agree? @StDxCorrosive Said what? @HA45z @StDxCorrosive That idolaters should be stone. @HA45z they may loathe gays but at least they don't hang them.Your point is invalid @lemonscrolls you said that I believe gays should be hung, I said I don't? How is my point invalid? @HA45z don't deny the truth go to any Islamic country and say you're gay and they will kill you @StDxCorrosive you aren't answering my replies that disprove yours and now you're changing the topic to stoning? @HA45z @StDxCorrosive No, I'm sorry I only saw the other reply. I'll go back and read the other replies. @HA45z @StDxCorrosive Defense vs going to another country in another time and killing possibly innocent people is different. @HA45z @StDxCorrosive War could be justified then, but when they set off bombs at a marathon or kill reporters in Paris its uncalled for. @lemonscrolls it is forbidden in the Quran to be gay. It is forbidden in the bible too and punishment for it there is also death. @StDxCorrosive Yes you're right, the US government and extremists do do this often. As well as the jews in Israel killing palestinians @HA45z the difference is Christians don't actually do it @StDxCorrosive we dont know if boston marathon was a hoax by government and in both it was a case of extremists, not true followers of islam @lemonscrolls Yes, apparently they don't follow what God wants them to do, the God they claim is all knowing @HA45z exactly because they realise that it is stupid @lemonscrolls if you choose to believe in God/a religion you cannot just hand pick what of it you want to believe in @lemonscrolls also this discussion is time consuming and going nowhere. Let us agree to disagree and be done with it :) @HA45z agreed.....faze4life",rumours

Lately in Paris, Ottawa, quebec etc these have been going on. @Jack31ish @BBCBreaking bbc is a little behind. @tykefreddy @worldcitizen_x  the human brain is not fully developed until 25. You will find most of these people are under that age @Aghanloo @worldcitizen_x do you know the age of today's attackers? @tykefreddy @worldcitizen_x  not yet?  Do you? @Aghanloo @BBCBreaking you can say that bcs you never heard what they say in mosques and also because you were not born in Islamic country @Aghanloo @worldcitizen_x no @Aghanloo @BBCBreaking and of courses if u heard u are not going to understand.. Good luck with defending with defunding stg you don't know @worldcitizen_x do you attend a mosque or are you basing your views on media and extremist views?  I live in Ireland @worldcitizen_x @BBCBreaking were do you live? @Aghanloo no I'm basing my views on 25 years living in Islamic country :) by the way age attackers 18, 32 and 34 @worldcitizen_x islamic culture is not going to change. Since the middle ages Europe have plundered the east and this has created tensions @worldcitizen_x we have created this situation and now it has exploded. WW3 will eventually have to happen before it gets resolved. @Aghanloo @BBCBreaking I was born and lived more than 25 years in Arabic Islamic hell, but fortunate now in Europe. Good night @worldcitizen_x @BBCBreaking good night @Aghanloo I didn't say that you should fight them but in Europe and US don't say the truth about islam and they misguide people @tykefreddy @worldcitizen_x 18, 32 &amp; 34 @Aghanloo @worldcitizen_x two of there brains are fully developed. @tykefreddy @Aghanloo @worldcitizen_x brothers reportedly both early thirties. Their brain knows well what it's doing, both this time &amp; last @tykefreddy @worldcitizen_x yes, however before the age of 25 they would have already been radicalised by extremist views. @flexgirl2 @Aghanloo @worldcitizen_x exactly. @tykefreddy @worldcitizen_x after 25 the brain will have formed beliefs. They then stay with you must of your adult life. @tykefreddy @worldcitizen_x extremist teenagers etc are less likely to question what they are being told by an authority figure. @Aghanloo I'd like to share with you info about islam, when people go deep in this religion then they became an atheist or IS member @worldcitizen_x http://t.co/ydq9nhLq6Z @Aghanloo otherwise who don't go deep they don't know a lot and that is what media call moderate Muslims @worldcitizen_x 100,000 out of a billion. .. @worldcitizen_x its the same with all religions.

Most of the wars are over oil and resources such as agricultural land and water. @Aghanloo I agree @worldcitizen_x humans are less than 200,000 years on this planet and we have destroyed what was here millions of years before us.  #virus @worldcitizen_x you have to remember most islamic terrorist get their arms from the US!

If you don't belief its ok. @thedahlimmama are you calling these executions bigotry? @1961Et @thedahlimmama @1961Et Bigotry is a state of mind where a person strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas @Canine_Rights @OicOzzie @thedahlimmama God was a creation of the human mind as a super cop to control human behaviour not d other way round @Canine_Rights @Cognicenti @thedahlimmama I dated a guy once who did not believe in GOD..I said its ok..he don't believe in you either. @thedahlimmama @1961Et these were actions considered heinous crimes, quite beyond bigotry. @Canine_Rights @Cognicenti @thedahlimmama When I told my ex bf that GOD did not believe in him ..he was offended? I think he feared GOD bein @Canine_Rights That's fine, instead of getting angry, explain your position on why you think it was wrong. #CoolHeads @thedahlimmama @1961Et @mannweil @Canine_Rights @Cognicenti Yes!! @aimee_curry @Canine_Rights @Cognicenti @thedahlimmama Maybe he put us here cause other planets were dying..or maybe ... @OicOzzie @Canine_Rights @thedahlimmama If there was a god violence of all types would not take place earth If there is god IT  is powerless Faith is the premise of all religion because there is no proof. Much less so for specific human ideas of what god is. @OicOzzie @Cognicenti @aimee_curry @Canine_Rights @Cognicenti @thedahlimmama or maybe GOD is like a scientist creating all kinds of life forms @mannweil @Canine_Rights @Cognicenti Or we can just acknowledge that majority do NOT act like this! Billions of ppl did NOT kill today! @Canine_Rights @thedahlimmama @1961Et I'm calling it an act of cowards and the perps should be shot and buried in pig shit IN PUBLIC! @aimee_curry @Canine_Rights @Cognicenti @thedahlimmama like earth is a living labatory and we are the experiment &amp; are FAILING. @TomCinmidlife I thought I did on multiple occasions and who's getting angry? @thedahlimmama @1961Et @TomCinmidlife why not come out and explain instead of pretend to be offended? @thedahlimmama @1961Et @TomCinmidlife I'm in no mood @thedahlimmama @1961Et @Canine_Rights Not angry here, and I saw no other ""multiple occasions"", just the one. :) @thedahlimmama @1961Et @Canine_Rights @Cognicenti MAYBE ...MAYBE NOT. I KNOW I BELIEVE IN A CREATOR WHO PUT US ON PLANET EARTH. @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et Bigotry meaning the ppl starting #s like kill all Muslims,and Muslim scum, etc. not within the next 50,000 years I'm afraid, evolution doesn't work that fast @thedahlimmama @mannweil @Cognicenti @Cognicenti @Canine_Rights @thedahlimmama iT TAKES POWER to make Earth..the SUN and all living creatures ..so I doubt being powerless is GOD @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et Dude, No! My point was the ppl who are saying kill all Muslims are wrong! I pointed out a Muslim was @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et killed! Our understanding of god is less than a bird's understanding of the moon. @OicOzzie @Cognicenti @thedahlimmama @OicOzzie @canine_rights @cognicenti @thedahlimmama Maybe. But humans are definitely a failure whether it was evolution of God @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et There was no euphemism. I seriously have no idea what you are talking about. @Canine_Rights @Cognicenti @thedahlimmama yes that is TRUE for some humans. @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et Ppl are saying kill all Muslims. I pointed out 1st person killed was Muslim&amp;that bigotry is wrong. @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et How is that a mantra?

At some point Religion will not exist. @riwired @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et a hashtag that says kill all Muslims is vile! @jeeesre Why #islam has become home to #radicalism such as #isis? Read here: http://t.co/WnFoxPmjTI @Cognicenti @Canine_Rights @OicOzzie @thedahlimmama The idea of God might prevail though. Seems like it's part of our DNA @riwired @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et Are you seriously trying to convince me Muslim terrorists are bad? Really? Um, no shit! @riwired @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et Exactly when did I support them?

If I read the Qu'ran ... ISIS seems to portray the TRUE Islam @Cognicenti @Canine_Rights @OicOzzie @thedahlimmama Fear? Of death? of course what psycho supports that? @thedahlimmama @riwired @TomCinmidlife @1961Et @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et I should wait until some RWNJ kills a bunch of innocent Muslims? Or Sikhs they misidentify! @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et Or not even RWNJs, I've just learned that MANY on left also can't tell difference between the 2 @thedahlimmama you can be tad more respectful to today's victims of fanaticism not just idiotic WORDS please @TomCinmidlife @1961Et @Canine_Rights @riwired @TomCinmidlife @1961Et The ppl I was referring to in tweet. Many ppl understood that! Twitter was trending hashtags @thedahlimmama get the difference between actions and words? Where was the last Muslim slaughter in the west? @TomCinmidlife @1961Et @Canine_Rights @riwired @TomCinmidlife @1961Et that were horrendous. My husband's bf&amp;battle buddy is Muslim,upsetting to see 1000s calling @Canine_Rights @riwired @TomCinmidlife @1961Et for his and his family's death! @jeeesre take a look at this article: http://t.co/4aeWlnvaOe highlights what you and ISIS misunderstood @thedahlimmama sure, yeah when did that happen in the west in this or last century @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et I TWEETED IN SUPPORT OF 1ST VICTIM! HOW IS THAT DISRESPECTFUL TO THE VICTIMS? @thedahlimmama after Pearl harbor? Incarceration is different that execution  @TomCinmidlife @1961Et @Canine_Rights So your pro free speech but i can't disagree with those calling for deaths of innocent Americans? @thedahlimmama I explained. You protect fictional victims while minimizing the atrocity of the real ones, that's how. @TomCinmidlife @1961Et @thedahlimmama got it @riwired @TomCinmidlife @1961Et @Canine_Rights You're anti-violence but I can't call for peace? You're anti-bigotry but I can't call out bigotry? @Canine_Rights Can you not fight w/someone you ACTUALLY disagree with? We freakin AGREE! @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et Are you talking to me?? Who said anything about Pearl Harbor? Or incarceration? I'm so lost @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et Seriously are you including me on different thread? You are tweeting me things I didn't ever mention? @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et Fictional victims? Yes, America has never killed innocent Muslims. Oh wait...#NoWMDs @IslamRevisited3 Ok read it. Now sent it to Islamists. I'm good. I don't believe in a creator. So no need for Qu'ran. @thedahlimmama I said in the west where these terrorists are organizing. And yes they went after oil rather then the Taliban. @TomCinmidlife @thedahlimmama also think you're forgetting a little thing like the invasion of Kuwait @TomCinmidlife @1961Et also like a decade of slaughter between Iranians and \Iraqis with MILLIONS KILLED - then they turned on Kuwait  @thedahlimmama its was a war crime Bush committed and Obama supported @thedahlimmama @TomCinmidlife @1961Et your making a historical case, I'm giving you examples  @thedahlimmama @TomCinmidlife @1961Et @thedahlimmama not on the back of today's victims @Canine_Rights Um yes, my Husband fought in that war,Bosnia&amp;Iraq 2nd time in 2003-2004 @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et No Pres Obama did not support it,one of a handful that voted against. @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et What??!! Will you please answer if you are speaking to me? I'm not making any points. @Canine_Rights @TomCinmidlife @1961Et I literally have no idea who you're speaking to. Who mentioned PH or incarceration? @thedahlimmama so you know whats been going on, whats the fear America will bomb ISIS positions? @Canine_Rights I tweeted in support of today's victim!! I do not understand why that's a problem. Did you even see my tweet? RIP to victim? @thedahlimmama which \Muslims are you afraid will be killed? @thedahlimmama what is it you are so afraid of, that overshadows today;s killings @thedahlimmama on the heels of your mantra @Canine_Rights I'm for that! Fully support that! They need to be eviscerated. @thedahlimmama good, we agree @Canine_Rights Do you know a hashtag #KillAllMuslims trended all day? I fear hate crimes. I fear invading wrong country again, etc @thedahlimmama really? Come on. @Canine_Rights Besides the fact it's just wrong. I tweeted 1 tweet, very innocuous tweet pointing out victim was a ""good Muslim"" @Canine_Rights why are you not attacking the 1000s tweeting in support of the terrorists?? Or ones calling for deaths of Billions of ppl? @Canine_Rights Did you bother to answer the reply I sent in support of bombing ISIS? Or are you just determined to argue w/me for no reason? @thedahlimmama enough. @thedahlimmama I'm talking about reality not stupid words that will never transpire obviously. Enough now. @Canine_Rights @thedahlimmama Me three. @Canine_Rights Yes, my mantra is #BigotryIsAlwaysWrong sorry you disagree.I'll assume you don't like anti-NA bigotry though?I oppose that 2 @Canine_Rights I completely agree!No one has ever upset me as much as you on here. We agree but you wanna fight for I don't know what reason @thedahlimmama To tell you the truth, I despise religion. Its superstitious nonsense. These killers take it to the next level. @thedahlimmama I try not to hate people who practice religion but it is used to oppress women especially, men and worst of all, children. @thedahlimmama It makes me angry, like why are they so brainwashed? Religion is a lie, none of them know anything. No god would condone this @RaHa762 I don't disagree but I know MANY religious ppl who do not use it to hate(I'm not)&amp;I won't hold them responsible for acts of others @thedahlimmama Buddists, unitarians, yes there are some. Most of them seem pretty bloodthirsty. @RaHa762 I do understand your point and have trouble with it sometimes myself @Cognicenti @jeeesre @Canine_Rights @thedahlimmama FEAR is not my reason for believing in GOD. I have come close to DEATH ..twice. @Cognicenti @jeeesre @Canine_Rights @thedahlimmama Due to poor sickness I almost died when I was 4 years old ,then again when I was 25. @Cognicenti @jeeesre @Canine_Rights @thedahlimmama I just believe in GOD &amp; I do not fear death for it is a part of our lives. @Cognicenti @jeeesre @Canine_Rights @thedahlimmama I chose to believe in the fact that a creator / A God or Gods put us on EARTH. @Cognicenti @jeeesre @Canine_Rights @thedahlimmama when you come clothes to death &amp; are in a hospital ...sick,..you do not fear death. @OicOzzie @jeeesre @Canine_Rights @thedahlimmama There is no harm in you believing in anything that you have been foisted with However(contd @OicOzzie @jeeesre @Canine_Rights @thedahlimmama you should not impose your believe on others through violence and discrimination @OicOzzie @jeeesre @Canine_Rights @thedahlimmama  Of course dis world has changed a lot over d last 200 yrs but it has to change a lot more @OicOzzie @jeeesre @Canine_Rights @thedahlimmama Whether you fear death or not it is a certainty &amp; truth If there was no death world (contd) @OicOzzie @jeeesre @Canine_Rights @thedahlimmama would have been the most monotonous &amp; abominable place in the universe",rumours

Or is it a plant? @BBCBreaking stupid or deliberate? @BBCBreaking @BBCr4today Well that's not in the slightest bit suspicious is it? @BBCBreaking they have taken their ID cards whilst they are going to a terrorist act? @BBCBreaking Clarence Worley @BBCBreaking seems strange that they had such military precision during the attack but then made this schoolboy error 😕 #CharlieHebdo @BBCBreaking why would he leave his ID behind, why? why would he wear a balaclava then leave his ID? He picked the runner of the road! @BBCBreaking Really? He left his ID? Do you not find that a bit strange? Maybe a finger print or something but his actual ID? .@BBCBreaking that ID card could easily have been planted by the murderers. Hope no one innocent gets hurt. @BBCBreaking highly suspicious about that personally @BBCBreaking @arthurbarbato Ha! what an idiot. @BBCBreaking US,European MSM present this news event as one of ""troubled,deranged,angry individuals"" not as an act of Islamic Terrorism. @BBCBreaking @tonyblackburn like he is that stupid to leave it there..what bullshit!! shame on you blackburn for helping the NEW WORLD ORDER @BBCBreaking I suspect this is, unfortunately, just the beginning of something even bigger #CharlieHebdo @BBCBreaking ...Despite french journalists said they were not amateurs... @BBCBreaking I always opposed ID cards. One reason being criminals are hardly likely to leave them at the scene of a crime - just shows you @BBCBreaking @BBCNews WHAT A FUCKING GENIUS! FUCKING MURDERING MORON EVEN BETTER!

This appeared to be a well-planned attack. It's like the supposed 9/11 hijacker's passport being found @Hashmat_M The runner was lost as it was too large. @Noopolitik even if it was a plant we have the accomplice to corroborate. Let's not humor any conclusions either way. @jayanthkumarak well, I can smell the bullshit from here... @Noopolitik so are you a truther? Jeez. You people are full of it. @jayanthkumarak and you seem a little confused brother. @Noopolitik maybe I am, but let's not fuel the fire that all of this is orchestrated to exploit Muslims. @jayanthkumarak I'm not saying that. I'm just saying this photo ID being found seems not to fit with the proposed scenario- or even logic. @DebateCait @BBCBreaking such military precision that they got the wrong address to start with. @jayanthkumarak @BBCBreaking reminds me of the passports 'miraculously' found at scene of 911. Looking more false flag by the hour. @Noopolitik @jayanthkumarak @BBCBreaking can anyone say ""false flag""? Who stands to gain from these murders? @mhoust42 @jayanthkumarak @BBCBreaking https://t.co/sQnGh83bFv this is very strange if the video is genuine. @Noopolitik @mhoust42 @BBCBreaking Unless you and I are ballistics and weapons specialists, we can't really infer seriously from this. @AndyinBrum @BBCBreaking I mean with regards to their tactical demonstration and weaponry skills, they'd been well trained for this mission. @jayanthkumarak @mhoust42 @BBCBreaking nope- and the video may have been tampered with. But IF this is genuine the shot missed. No blood. @Noopolitik @mhoust42 @BBCBreaking But the body is in the mortuary there, for people to verify from, i'm sure. Let's be practical. @jayanthkumarak @mhoust42 @BBCBreaking Maybe. We don't know what happened. I'll keep an open mind. @Noopolitik @mhoust42 @BBCBreaking  But remember it is a publicized event, we needn't set the flame to a clash of civilizations. It isn't. @jayanthkumarak @mhoust42 @BBCBreaking EXACTLY. Some people would like us to think it is. Hence incidents like this. I wonder why..? ;) @Noopolitik  You're being willfully ignorant of the geopolitical situation in large parts of South Asia and Mid-East. You're wiser than that @jayanthkumarak  There are real bad guys. But on the whole people want to get along in peace. That doesn't suit some people's agenda... @Noopolitik While you'd like to think so, i invite you to visit India, and Pakistan. Lots of people on either side don't want to get along. @jayanthkumarak I lived in the Middle East and elsewhere. Powerful vested interests manipulate geopolitics-  most people want peace. @Noopolitik The Mid-East is a geopolitical quagmire. We can have several long discussions on all this.

Making it about his feel feels after a teen has been murdered?! @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ White people love the victim card. @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ They've been making this whole situation all about them by focusing on the looting. @WyzeChef @TheBlackVoice He couldn't have been serious... They are so oblivious its damn near hilarious! @OberstabKrieger @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ I don't think looting is effective.  But I'm not going to judge because I don't live there. @OberstabKrieger @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ If that happened in my neighborhood I can't promise that I wouldn't want to tear something up. @WyzeChef @xianb8 but that story about a kid attacking a cop for no reason while on his way to his grandmother's house makes so much sense If Red Riding Hood was black, media/cops would've put wolf on paid vacation &amp; talked about his wolf tearz @tklowenstein @WyzeChef #Ferguson @WyzeChef officially my favorite use of this! .@WyzeChef If the #Ferguson chief thinks his feelings are relevant to his job, that's probably part of the problem. @WyzeChef @Principia bummer that…So, since when did the cops start having feelings that could be hurt ? @WyzeChef @Principia “My officers don’t go around gratuitously shooting ppl and then bragging about it in seedy paramilitary cop bars…"" @WyzeChef @Principia “They go around gratuitously shooting ppl and then agonize about it on social media…and they write poetry” @WyzeChef @Principia Art srsly, Douglas Adams called it... @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ That's the pot calling the kettle black! @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__  Please don't do the same thing they do, in reverse.  It's ""some"" white people.  :) @LibertyIsALady @ShannonLeeKiss @AdmireLaniya__ no doubt. @WyzeChef @ShannonLeeKiss @AdmireLaniya__  ♥ @LibertyIsALady @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ It's many.  I don't buy into reverse racism.  It's a farce. @joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ If you don't see that young man as a victim than I don't know what one is. @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ Never said he wasn't. I was replying to your racist comment above. @joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ It seems to me that many non Black people are focused on the civil disturbances more than the dead kid. @joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ I think that's awful and self centered.  They are making it all about them and how they are affected. @joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ But that would never happen to their kid so they don't really seem to care.  It's upsetting. @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ The whole situation is awful. The officer should be held accountable for his action. @joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ Absolutely!  The looting is unfortunate but I'm not going to judge those people. @joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ If I lived there I can't promise that I would react differently. @joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ So many people are interested in raking the protesters over the coals instead of looking ... @joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ at what caused their reaction. @joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ Thanks for listening. @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ We should never as people respond to a crime with crime. We should do what's right. @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ Even though it seems difficult. This country doesn't need racial division. We are Americans. @joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ I agree.  I hope the Ferguson PD comes to the same conclusion @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__  It's too many, that's for sure. @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ BTW - you said ""white people love the victim card"" and I felt judged because of my skin color. @LibertyIsALady @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef boo fucking hoo join the club. Advocate that same thing for PoC and stop thinking of yourself @AdmireLaniya__ @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef   You should recognize a friend when you see one. I believe the solution is thinking of everyone. @LibertyIsALady @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef Well I don't. And you've done anything but prove yourself as a ""friend"" whatever that means. @ShannonLeeKiss u r tweeting w/white ppl right now who r on ur side yet u condemned us all. C problem?@joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ @AdmireLaniya__ @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef   Your anger is understandable.  But your generalized judgement is a shame. @petee224 @ShannonLeeKiss @joshmhump @WyzeChef Yes. Because you feel that having white people on our side should be such a blessing. @petee224 @ShannonLeeKiss @joshmhump @WyzeChef We should be so thankful for it. The comment was a generalization but that generalization @AdmireLaniya__ no need to be condescending. So by your comment its us against them? @AdmireLaniya__ @petee224 @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef I agree with @petee224 @AdmireLaniya__ @ShannonLeeKiss @joshmhump @WyzeChef always a blessing when people stand together for what's right. http://t.co/f4lkRMjFMU @petee224 @ShannonLeeKiss @joshmhump @WyzeChef exactly. So don't lose the purpose of the tweet by RahRahing for white people over a genrlztn @AdmireLaniya__ @petee224 @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef RahRahing for white people? @joshmhump @petee224 @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef advocating against meaningless and harmless white prejudice. @AdmireLaniya__ @petee224 @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef I didn't advocate for white people. So you're saying every white person is racist. @joshmhump @petee224 @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef I clearly said prejudice. @LibertyIsALady @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ I don't know you personally.  I judge people as individuals. @LibertyIsALady @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ But if I had to make a generalization about WP it would be that most of them harbor some racism. @LibertyIsALady @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ Based on my personal experiences, 39 years of observations, history and current events ... @LibertyIsALady @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ most people would objectively come to the same conclusion. @LibertyIsALady @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ Me blowing smoke up your behind would not do anyone any good. @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__  Sad.  Nonetheless, I'll stand for your rights. @LibertyIsALady @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ Stand for the Constitution and the American Dream.  That's what's being violated. @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__  I do.  And more. @WyzeChef @pixiestateomind that time Mike Brown has no feelings to speak of.",rumours

If so, why didn't he stop them and check them? @napps126 @DanteB4u I'm all types of confused. @MarkMC9 @DanteB4u shits not adding up. What convenient store was robbed?

By definition, he is lying in at least one of them. @scATX @rgay 😥 @r4v5 @scATX He could be, or he could have been given bad info before. But given Ferguson history, it doesn't look good for chief. @r4v5 @scATX Jose Guerena case shows cops may lie to deflect blame. Guerena's family won lawsuit, but Tucson sheriff won reelection anyway. @caldodge @scATX if he's ""been given bad info before"" and publicly states that bad info, that is called ""lying"" @r4v5 @scATX Not if he doesn't know it's bad info at the time. @r4v5 @scATX If somebody tells you something that's not true, and you repeat it (because you thought it was truth), does that make you liar? @caldodge @scATX depends on the obligation one would expect you to do due diligence before passing on lies, no? @r4v5 @scATX It's called delegation. Person in charge expects underlings to do gruntwork of due diligence. @scATX @MaraWritesStuff - unpopular opinion incoming. Would this have been as big, if the police officer was dead instead? @r4v5 @scATX I'm not asserting police chief IS telling truth. I'm saying he COULD have thought story was truth at time. @Gorbles @MaraWritesStuff What is your point? @scATX - because making an emotive tweet on a tragic death isn't the best presentation of it. I doubt it'd have been done for the officer. @Gorbles An unarmed kid was shot dead in the street, his body left for hours, and the police keep changing the story. EXCUSE MY EMOTING. @Gorbles why the fuck does it matter what would be done if it had been the officer? IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN; THE KID WAS UNARMED. @Gorbles you wanting to change the story to make this about the not-dead or not-even-injured or not-arrested cop is ridiculous derailing. @Gorbles also it's not an opinion. @scATX - sorry for that impression, I don't want to make it about the officer. I want objective views, not emotive tangents. Nothing more. @Gorbles idea that anything can be ""objective"" is false. And the idea that ""emotion"" somehow means ""not trustworthy"" = WHATEVER @Gorbles @scATX Not sure why you think anybody gives a fuck what you ""want"". @scATX - Twitter's crap at letting me get it all out decently. Basically, reminding people someone's dead is pointless. Everyone knows (1/2) @scATX - you're in a position of authority, and you're using that to leverage this view. Just my opinion, I'm not the only one to reply. @Philosopher_Dad - nor you. Personal attacks aren't the best way to conduct yourself, yo. @Gorbles it's not pointless. And fuck yeah, I am leveraging my opinion. It's my Twitter account. I should apologize for this? @scATX - not at all, sorry again. I'm offering my opinion like you were offering yours. That's all. I didn't even expect a reply! @Gorbles surprise! @scATX @Gorbles This. we are made up of emotion. Objective is often a code for male/real/white. @JulieGillisTX @scATX - we are indeed, but ya need to consider things without emotion sometimes. Judges don't rule on emotion! @Gorbles @JulieGillisTX hahahahahahaa sure ok, player @Gorbles @JulieGillisTX I think you really need to study ""objectivity"" and question that concept. @JulieGillisTX @scATX @Gorbles his profile states 100% dolt. we have our answer. @scATX @JulieGillisTX - sure thing. I'm young, I've got plenty to learn. @meadowgirl - in joke, community-related. It's funny how quick people jump to insults though :/ @Gorbles Yo, go fuck yourself, yo. @Gorbles waaaa waaaaaa poor widdle white dude feefees. yawn. don't make it about emotion! suck it up! @Gorbles @JulieGillisTX @scATX yeah, definitely no ""emotion"" in the way the criminal justice system pursues alleged cop killers either. @meadowgirl - I'm not. It's funny. Having to resort to personal attacks in order to bait some kinda rise. @dansolomon @JulieGillisTX @scATX - definitely a huge problem. The biggest problem here though is a lack of transparency all round. @dansolomon @JulieGillisTX @scATX - not that I ever stated what my feelings on the #Ferguson situation was. Death is awful. @Gorbles yes, yes bc you are clearly the smartest, best and more deserving of humanity. yes, we know white man, it is about YOU here. @meadowgirl - more about me than you, given the attention I'm getting. Peace out. @Gorbles @scATX If you really think that you need to go back to school. Everyone absolutely does, unless they are sociopathic. @JulieGillisTX @scATX - if a judge ever sent someone to prison because the judge didn't like the defendant, then that's unlawful. @JulieGillisTX @scATX - deciding without emotions on occasion != devoid of emotions (sociopathy). @Gorbles @JulieGillisTX @scATX don't know what your point is. People are emotional when someone's shot. If it's a cop, cops are emotional. @dansolomon @JulieGillisTX @scATX - original point was lost somewhat, no worries. People are emotional, never disputed that. @Gorbles @JulieGillisTX @scATX when it's a kid, people who empathize with kids are emotional. There is no emotion-free perspective. @dansolomon @JulieGillisTX @scATX - when observing the situation, then you have to have more of a clear head.",rumours

No weapons were involved. Shoplifting, maybe, but robbery?? @quickshift268 @MichaelaAngelaD There are no facts that say he was a criminal. There aren't even facts that there was a ""robbery."" @decyberdiva @MichaelaAngelaD It's a robbery the second you touch an employee. W/out weapons it's strong arm robbery. @decyberdiva @MichaelaAngelaD http://t.co/iqqwrmf4EM @decyberdiva @MichaelaAngelaD picture on top shows the robbery.  Called a strong arm robbery,  and it's a felony @quickshift268 @MichaelaAngelaD Strong-armed robbery involves a WEAPON. No weapon shown here. @slow17motion @MichaelaAngelaD Oh so now we're making up terms to suit murdering an 18-year old for shoplifting. @quickshift268 @MichaelaAngelaD Of course conveniently PD deletes the part of the video that shows he PAID FOR THEM...http://t.co/vw7MoLcwty @slow17motion He paid for them. Why delete that part of the video??? http://t.co/vw7MoLcwty @decyberdiva If he paid for him, why would his friend admit they stole them? LOL. I often admit to crimes I never committed. @slow17motion http://t.co/vw7MoLcwty @slow17motion It's easier for U to believe a lie than the truth/video. The store didn't report a robbery. No weapons. http://t.co/vw7MoLcwty @decyberdiva Johnson admitted it. Brown violently shoved the clerk. End of story. @decyberdiva are you so desperate for him to have been an angel? He wasn't. He was an asshole. It's sort of beside the point though. @slow17motion You knew him personally? Oh, right. You just built all of this up in your mind. @slow17motion He paid for the cigars. End of story. @decyberdiva You're one dumb bitch. lol @slow17motion You're an idiot and a racist! LOL @decyberdiva Racist = The word idiots use when they lose an argument. @slow17motion Actually it's a word used when dealing with a racist. @slow17motion Name calling is a tactic used by #GOP right-wingers who have #nofactsjustpersonalattacks @decyberdiva Fact: Dorian Johnson admitted to robbing store. (that's an ACTUAL fact). @decyberdiva not a fact: I'm a right winger because I believe in due process. You seem to think that anyone who doesn't agree with you... @decyberdiva ...is a racist republican. That's called a stereotype, which is actually much closer to racism. Let me give you another fact. @decyberdiva fact: I'm an independent who has never voted republican. I'm a minority who doesn't have rights you likely take for granted @slow17motion I'm an ex-Republicann now Independent, who doesn't like tea party nut jobs and I take my rights extremely seriously. @slow17motion Fact: the surveillance video shows him paying for the cigars. Fact: store never called in a robbery @decyberdiva I've never been a Republican, never voted for a Republican, and have ALWAYS been an independent. As a gay man, I also take my @decyberdiva rights very seriously. @decyberdiva I watched the surveillance video--including the 'new one' where people say he paid. I don't see him paying. @decyberdiva I also saw him push that clerk and walk him down. Terrible behavior. Seems like an asshole. BUT-being an asshole doesn't get a @decyberdiva bullet. However, we don't actually KNOW what happened yet between Wilson and Brown. Hopefully investigation will get answers. @slow17motion Store didn't report a robbery. Didn't know why police wanted surveillance footage. @slow17motion Clerk pushed him first. Does that make him an a*shole? @slow17motion we know a cop shot an unarmed 18 year old at least six times. @decyberdiva The clerk was not pushing him for fun. He was obviously doing something he wasn't supposed to... You're getting too much of @decyberdiva your info from DailyKos. lol @decyberdiva So? That doesn't mean it wasn't justified. Cops shoot unarmed people all the time if they are threatened. It's justifiable. @slow17motion my point is if someone pushes you, expect to be pushed back @decyberdiva I had a co-worker whose son was shot because he was committing an unarmed robbery. Justifiable. (And the shooter was civilian.) @slow17motion doesn't make either one an a*shole @decyberdiva After somebody walks out of a store with your shit? C'mon. @decyberdiva I've never pushed a clerk. @decyberdiva Stop reading Dailykos. Not a reliable source. Stick to major news outlets (and take with grain of salt). @decyberdiva A wise man once said: ""Believe your eyes, not the lies."" I don't see Brown paying for anything. I see an altercation between @decyberdiva a clerk and a customer. The customer has unbagged items in his hands and the clerk is pursuing. Brown shoves the clerk then @decyberdiva walks him down. That's what I see. Sorry. @slow17motion meanwhile James Eagan Holmes shoots 82 people in Aurora and is taken alive... @slow17motion If there was a robbery, the store would have reported it. thats what I know. Sorry. @slow17motion Please. This is what happens when you believe your own eyes...http://t.co/Bcu22RBBiN @decyberdiva Erm...Okay? (Unrelated...) @decyberdiva Okay, so where in the video is he paying? @decyberdiva Do we know why the clerk bothered pursuing him? Why pursue if he paid? @decyberdiva Let's pretend I DO see him paying--which I don't... Then there's this! (lol) https://t.co/neYdc8crRD @slow17motion actually it's very pertinent. try this one. It gets to the point quicker...https://t.co/aYtF48WTDa @decyberdiva Using this as evidence for the Brown case is a logical fallacy called 'faulty generalization.' @slow17motion No robbery. No weapons. Sorry. I don't believe an unarmed 18 year old should be shot for shoplifting either. @slow17motion ROTFLMAO. Yeah right. Easy to say when the generalizations aren't being made about you. @slow17motion Lets be real, if Justin Beiber was shot for shoplifting cigars from a convenience store we'd be taking about excess force.' @slow17motion Justin or Wynonna... @decyberdiva It's robbery if you touch a person in the store. @decyberdiva Err... First of all... It's an actual LOGICAL FALLACY (it's a philosophical term). Second of all, it's a fallacy that... @decyberdiva ...discredits generalizations. @slow17motion since when? Since Michael Brown was shot? Strong-armed robbery is robbery using a weapon. @slow17motion There's no such animal as a ""Strong-arm"" robbery. @decyberdiva Let's be real... It has a lot to do with the threat a person poses. Bieber = minimal threat. Guy who is angry and 6'4""... @decyberdiva Um. Yes there is. It's a legal term. @decyberdiva http://t.co/izQFOzrZYp @slow17motion Robbery is theft using threat of DEADLY Force. @decyberdiva No--it's not. You're obviously not a lawyer. @slow17motion This isn't remotely what happened in this situation. @slow17motion LOL. Now that's funny! @decyberdiva Theft is the ABSENCE of force. Robbery is any application of force, even a nudge can bump it from theft to robbery. @slow17motion Yes, it it. For it to be robbery, there must be fear of deadly harm. @decyberdiva This is pointless. Just look it up. I'm through here. @slow17motion Oh, please! @decyberdiva http://t.co/4wEg4RzlS8 @decyberdiva QUOTE FROM WEBSITE: Robbery is a violent crime, but that doesn’t mean the victim has to suffer any type of injury @decyberdiva It’s enough to commit a robbery if you use any type of force to take property from someone @decyberdiva I hope you're an adjunct, because if not, you're a fucktarded law professor. @slow17motion The operative word here is violent. I never said a word about an injury. I said FEAR. @decyberdiva NOWHERE IN ANY LAW BOOK does it say robbery involves the threat or application of DEADLY FORCE. @decyberdiva Go ahead, prove me wrong. @slow17motion LOL!!! Whatever... @decyberdiva So you're arguing that the legal definition of robbery vs. theft is contingent upon the victim's ""feelings"" LOL @slow17motion FEAR. That's F-E-A-R. @decyberdiva You said the threat of DEADLY FORCE is required. It's absolutely NOT. @decyberdiva Um, the victim doesn't have to FEAR FOR HIS/HER LIFE for it to be a robbery, you jerk. LOL. You're ridiculous. @slow17motion Absolutely. Fear of violence doesn't mean being pushed. Give me a break. @decyberdiva In fact, the person doesn't have to FEEL anything. It's robbery if force or the THREAT OF FORCE is used. @decyberdiva It's an act of violence. So, yes, that's included under FORCE. @slow17motion If I walk into a store and say give me all of your money or I'll push you….that's a robbery???? PUH-leaze. @decyberdiva Actually, even if he HADN'T pushed him, if he took something then WALKED HIM DOWN, that's still robbery. Research is fun. @slow17motion Great. See you in court. @decyberdiva It's a threat of violence AND you're taking something in the person's control. Yes, that's robbery. @decyberdiva Well, it's robbery once something is taken. @decyberdiva If you walk into a store, shove the clerk, and take a candy bar. It's robbery. If you take the candy bar and sneak out, theft. @decyberdiva I'd hope so, you're a hot mess. @slow17motion Hey, we define violence differently. And of course, depending on who's doing what, we'll label it differently. @decyberdiva (I'm not defining it. I'm letting the LAW define it. That's why I'm giving sources...) @slow17motion You know, like the boys sleeping in the car in the video I posted were plotting a robbery, according to 9-1-1 calls. @slow17motion Ah, but he didn't walk into the store and shove the clerk. @decyberdiva Two issues: Stereotyping shouldn't ever occur. Stereotypes are not always baseless. (The second one makes me racist, right?) @slow17motion He didn't walk into the store and threaten the clerk either. @decyberdiva Let me give you an example. Many people think all gay men are lisping, mincing fairies. I'm not. However--it's not baseless... @decyberdiva ...many gay men are lisping, mincing fairies. @decyberdiva If you're a police officer--you're not supposed to use racial profiling (or security at an airport)... However, there is reason @slow17motion He walked up to the register. There doesn't seem to be any altercation at the counter. @decyberdiva to profile. Who's more likely to blow up a plane? A middle aged man of middle eastern decent--or a 95 year old white woman? @decyberdiva You're making suppositions. Fact is, it's unclear. Johnson doesn't dispute a crime happened. All sources reporting (like @decyberdiva dailykos) are trash. It looks like a strong arm robbery to me. You disagree. We should move on from this. @slow17motion except for the 9-1-1 bombers had European passports, dyed hair and didn't look middle eastern. @decyberdiva http://t.co/pKdeR46ED6 Unless they completely changed their faces, they looked middle eastern. lol. @slow17motion LOL. Suppositions? You mean like the ones you're making? @slow17motion You're right. These are suppositions! &amp; they shouldn't matter. The policeman didn't know anything about the convenience store @decyberdiva What I'm getting to is this. 1/11 black men are in prison. 1/45 white men are in prison. 11-12% of Americans are black. They @slow17motion We see the same things and yet see different things. That's human nature and that's the problem here. @decyberdiva make up 40% of the prison population. It's not COMPLETELY absurd that cops would use these statistics and profile. @decyberdiva No, it's not RIGHT. It's stereotyping--but it makes logical sense. Sad but true. @slow17motion That is why there is such unrest in Ferguson right now. Because I never know when what you're seeing isn't what I'm seeing. @decyberdiva There's unrest because the popular narrative is that a white police officer gunned down a young black man for no reason. @slow17motion MOST crime is committed by whites. Blacks go to jail more often than whites for the same offenses. @decyberdiva (And for a smaller percentage of protesters there's unrest because, hey, who doesn't love flat screens?) @decyberdiva Doesn't mean that's what happened. We don't KNOW what happened. @decyberdiva True. Whites are the majority of the population. @slow17motion indeed. @decyberdiva Blacks go to jail more often. Also true. That could account for some of the discrepancy. However, even if it counted as HALF of @decyberdiva the discrepancy, that would still mean a black man is twice as likely to commit a crime as a white man. @decyberdiva Much of it has to do with economics. @decyberdiva Economically, black men tend to be more likely to live in poverty. @slow17motion Ummm. Gunned down an unarmed man. The reason matters little. @decyberdiva Regardless of the reasons, though--black men are still statistically much more likely to commit crime. Hence profiling. @slow17motion Sorry. Faulty math there. @decyberdiva Sad? YES. Unfair? ABSOLUTELY. Logical? Well..yeah. @decyberdiva No, it's not. If 1/11 black men are incarcerated vs. 1/45 white men, that means that 10% of black men are imprisoned. 2% white. @decyberdiva I discounted HALF of those crimes for reasons you mentioned: 5% black men vs. 2% white men. @slow17motion That only proves what I said earlier, that black men are arrested and convicted for situations white men get away with. @decyberdiva So, in a way you're right. An individual black man, statistically would be MORE THAN TWICE as likely, discounting 1/2 of crimes @slow17motion You can't supposed from that any greater propensity for crime. Sorry. @decyberdiva Actually... You absolutely can. Mathematically it's true. I don't think melanin has anything to do with it though. @decyberdiva I argue that economics and a culture that glamorizes crime have to do with it. @slow17motion Nope. Not true. Sorry. @decyberdiva Also, the war on drugs increased all incarcerations significantly. @decyberdiva You don't like math? @slow17motion Statistically, since there are more white people and they commit the majority of crime... @slow17motion you are more likely to stumble across a criminal by targeting white men. @decyberdiva Yes, we're talking PERCENTAGES though. @decyberdiva If you're talking about profiling, you're talking about likelihood, that mean's PERCENTAGES. @decyberdiva No, you're not. If you took 100 white men and 100 black men, statistics show only TWO white men would be criminals. (10 black) @decyberdiva Yes, there are MORE white people. But that is irrelevant to the point I'm making. @decyberdiva Are there MORE white criminals? YES! There are WAY MORE WHITES. Are they more LIKELY to be criminals. NO. Not by a longshot. @decyberdiva It's about PERCENTAGES (profiling is ALL about percentages) @slow17motion You can twist percentages around to mean a lot of things. @decyberdiva Blacks make up nearly 1 million of the 2.3 million prison pop. in the US. That's 6x more than whites. Statistically, it has @decyberdiva been predicted that 1/3 black men will spend time in prison during their lifetimes. (Most for non violent drug offenses.) @decyberdiva I am an advocate for short term sentences for non violent offenders and legalizing marijuana. I dislike profiling immensely. @decyberdiva However, I understand why it is used. @decyberdiva No, this is pretty cut and dry. It's not statistics from disputed studies of small populations. This is from census data. @decyberdiva Every man and woman should be judged as an INDIVIDUAL. Every man and woman has the right to due process--regardless of race. @decyberdiva This includes ALL black men...and yes, Darren Wilson too. Being a policeman is not an easy job and they're easy to demonize. @decyberdiva How about we wait to demonize this one until the facts are in? If he's guilty--demonize away. @slow17motion Not for legalizing marijuana at all. sorry. @slow17motion Not demonizing. However, paid leave is hard to stomach. @slow17motion And there's a history of problems in Ferguson that go beyond one incident. @decyberdiva I've never tried marijuana--but I know from personal (family) experience, that it doesn't ruin life quite like booze. @slow17motion Alters brain chemistry, mood altering, kills memory, brain cells.. @decyberdiva Of course it's mood altering. That's the point. Brain cells are not killed. At worst it increases the speed at which the brain @decyberdiva deteriorates with age. The most respected studies show that THC does NOT kill brain cells with daily or even heavy use. @decyberdiva It's actually healthier than cigarettes (which are physically addictive, THC is not), and it does less damage than booze. @slow17motion Psychiatric effects of cannabis | http://t.co/1U6EXQFuQT @slow17motion Psychology Today: Marijuana addiction is real | http://t.co/03TaRfyAI0 @slow17motion Marijuana, brain disorders and schizophrenia | http://t.co/TMpOON12i5 @slow17motion  All of the experts agree it causes the amotivational syndrome and decreases memory...http://t.co/DTqolqYxZu @slow17motion 10 Reasons to stay away from weed. 8.

Fact. @decyberdiva It's ironic you'd cite one very biased source to show ALL EXPERTS AGREE (they don't). @decyberdiva It's as real as any mental addiction. It's not physically addictive. @decyberdiva Nobody is arguing that marijuana doesn't have some negative effects. It's still better than booze, which is legal. @decyberdiva Honestly, the negative effects are minimal and manageable if used with caution and care. @slow17motion Again, I disagree. @slow17motion Nope. Not a fact. Weed causes permanent personality changes and can cause irritably and aggressiveness. @slow17motion Sorry you need to tell this to someone who hasn't seen the opposite first hand. @decyberdiva I've known plenty of potheads that function just fine and are active, intelligent people. @decyberdiva THC is like anything else--if you abuse it, it's going to have negative effects. Same with booze, cigs, fatty foods, etc. @slow17motion thats like saying i know plenty of alcoholics that function just fine.. @slow17motion http://t.co/8qlF5e78HE @decyberdiva everyone knows that white men tend to get killed by white men and black men by black men. Not new. @slow17motion Great. This entire exchange started over my comment about using black-on-black crime as a subterfuge. http://t.co/7Kc7443cQL @decyberdiva what are you talking about? @decyberdiva you really aren't very good with deciphering our giving meaning to statistics @decyberdiva ask yourself why black on black crime might be a focus of media attention and white on white crime isn't. @decyberdiva the answers are all there in the statistics. All you need to do is think about them. @decyberdiva of interracial crime, blacks commit 85%. Many times more likely to commit homicide. Black on black violence is a problem... @decyberdiva disproportionately, black men commit violent crimes. It's a problem that needs a solution. Hence the media focus. @decyberdiva read up http://t.co/o48Popxfuw @slow17motion stop the lies... @slow17motion the way to fix this is to stop stripping the wealth from black communities @slow17motion disproportionately property values are devalued in black communities, disproportionately black incomes are predominately less @slow17motion this is nonsense. this is why my children need protection from twisted thinking like yours. @decyberdiva Regardless of the reasons, there are more black criminals. It's not exactly a lie. I mentioned economic factors. @decyberdiva You wonder why property values are lower in black neighborhoods? See earlier statistics. @decyberdiva You can blame the gov't, the economy, schools, whatever. In the end, you have to acknowledge that violence is a PROBLEM in... @decyberdiva ...black communities. Nobody is going to ride in and save them. They need to save themselves. The best way is to change the... @decyberdiva ...cultural values in these communities, reduce drug use and gang influence, and encourage higher education. @decyberdiva You didn't find this funny? http://t.co/89RVxg90RZ @decyberdiva http://t.co/Yup745DrDu (The source I meant to post.) @decyberdiva You post one european-centric white supremacist website and EVERYBODY thinks you're a racist. #jokez @slow17motion http://t.co/FpYYu9CDnx @slow17motion http://t.co/d8v2Aghvjd @slow17motion YOu watch way too many movies.

And the narrative is always that the dead Black kid had it coming.  Angry! @oh_so_sweet1 we will see man. I'm not jumping to any conclusion. I'll admit it does fit his description but you cold be right @oh_so_sweet1 that logo on his hat and shoes will tell all. And the store victim @oh_so_sweet1 *could @Fieryreddrago @cricticalnamest too many lies by #Ferguson police @cricticalnamest http://t.co/t2Fy6oLQyI
#Ferguson #MikeBrown all I got to say @oh_so_sweet1 that video which I seen a few days ago is  irrevlant. He wasn't there when the store was rob no. He was there when the cop @oh_so_sweet1 shot him @oh_so_sweet1 this video proves nothing. We will see wants the store video and victim of store speaks @cricticalnamest ur rite I need those ppl from the store to come forward, the photo of the cop who claims he got beat by #MikeBrown, @cricticalnamest #MikeBrown finger print of the officer gun which is hard to take out a holder @AntonioFrench @ClassyKelly he says if was not quik trip. And i hear ferguson market says he paid. @Only1Rahk @AntonioFrench ok...🙏 all the truth actually comes out. @ClassyKelly @AntonioFrench rellos 2 for 99cent. That's robbery? Even 6 packs don't run u 10. RT @Only1Rahk: @ClassyKelly @AntonioFrench rellos 2 for 99cent. That's robbery? Even 6 packs don't run u 10. @Only1Rahk once you push an employee it's strong-arm robbery. @ClassyKelly look at the times on the frames. 52 to 53. And somebody said ferguson said he paid, so was there another altercation? @ClassyKelly shoplifting and assault. Strong arm would be pushing the employee to obtain the items, no? @Only1Rahk value of the property not a factor. Robbery is a taking by use of force/fear. Still, didn't look like Mike on that tape @Only1Rahk I agree. Doesn't match up...I'm just telling you why he's accused of robbery not shoplifting @Only1Rahk nope. @JEvansJD precisely but robbery over shoplifting enhances the perception. And strong arm would be forcefully taking. He was on his way out @ClassyKelly I'm almost positive if I push u on my way out it doesn't turn into strong arm robbery. U may want to look that up. @Only1Rahk news says suspect pushed employee when asked to pay for cigarillos. @AntonioFrench @rolandsmartin just incredible that we are still dealing with young black men dying at the hands of those who should protect. @AntonioFrench regardless even if #MikeBrown DID something(as alleged) the price 4 any scuffle shouldn't be being MURDERED by #Ferguson cops @mickgoddess @mrmedina THANK YOU!!! @brandwithoutana @mrmedina I just call them the way I see them. “@mickgoddess: @brandwithoutana @mrmedina I just call them the way I see them.” #JusticeForMikeBrown “@AntonioFrench: The info given today seems to line up w/ witness account, even the alleged theft: http://t.co/0raRhxDfre "" @RonnieNotch @kmlindem @AntonioFrench Yea I'm really confused on that part of the video as well... @AntonioFrench I remember watching this video on Monday. @dregan08 @AntonioFrench Yeah, I still don't hear that kid saying they stole them. @AntonioFrench also lines up pretty well with the witness MSNBC spoke with last night. @AntonioFrench Dorian says the cashier didn't call police. Is there a tape of the 911 call? @AntonioFrench Autopsy results will help corrobor refute. Dorian says he was hit by car door, shot in head at close range, shot after dead. .@AntonioFrench #MikeBrown as suspect should've been made public MUCH earlier-Todays PD report=legal tactic as I said http://t.co/eeLYxqGmfm @AntonioFrench This was the first eyewitness account I'd seen, and this man still hasn't been interviewed. @AntonioFrench @jfpatriot Please interpret that for us white people. Sub titles maybe. @Zoot16 @AntonioFrench from what I understand from the video. He agrees with the police report. Sorry that is the best I can do. @jfpatriot @AntonioFrench Thanks. @AntonioFrench This is devastating.

It actually looks a lot like a looter with their face  covered that was photographed by @PDPJ @mashable check your facts and the pics from what he was wearing when he was gunned down, smh @mashable Good folk of Ferguson, Support your Police Dept., Riot against the THUGS in your town. This proves what? RT@mashable Update: #Ferguson police release stills from convenience store footage showing robbery http://t.co/osYABuPvd7 @mashable Gentle Giant, RIGHT. Go arrest that partner he had too. @mashable JUSTICE FOR THE POLICE DEPT. they were doing their job &amp; protecting your sorry butts. @mashable @AdamBaldwin Waiting to see an outpouring of sympathy for the owner of the store that was attacked.  Not holding my breath. @mashable @progress4ohio doesn't excuse murder @mashable that dude is huge @TracyMo53321503 @mashable are you really justifying the murder of an unarmed kid? o @mashable red hat? @zadiaz @mashable He wasn't a kid, an Adult who was robbing a business. @mashable if the officer did his job he would be arrested not murdered. Still the point. @TracyMo53321503 @mashable are you justifying the murder of an unarmed ADULT? @mashable here goes the fukkry now look at his picture.o wait he is black robber black. Has it been confirmed. Or just blow smoke our bum @zadiaz @mashable YES, it was JUSTIFIED @mashable umm wasn't Mike Brown wearing pants, and shoes? @TracyMo53321503 @zadiaz @mashable you are saying that's mike brown in the picture? It's not. Two events unconnected. What's your point? @TracyMo53321503 @mashable you're one sick racist bitch @drpolson @zadiaz @mashable You are a Peter Piper follower. Monkey see, monkey do. @zadiaz @mashable You're one sick stupid person. @TracyMo53321503 @zadiaz @mashable what point are you making about the photo? @mashable If this is real, I feel one of those #aweshit moments coming on both sides, the neighborhood and the police. @mashable this is mike brown stop lying and get your facts straight next time you insult another HUMANS life http://t.co/W7Lmtv1i1U @KAEP555 @mashable He is large. In the store photos you have some prospective unlike the still photos. @accordingtoame @mashable @PDPJ Take a look at college football players, roughly same size and maturity (in terms of looking older). @species8472xgn @mashable @PDPJ my brother played, I'm familiar with their size @CheriPhi @mashable That maybe he did try &amp; take cops gun though window (something witnesses could not see). This goes toward CHARACTER. 😐 @species8472xgn @mashable i'd be a bad witness @mashable Wow! @4DawnMarie @mashable I'm looking for his read hat and his flip flops can you find them? http://t.co/9bVeE3q8Qk @marruffosc @mashable I didn't head you 👂 http://t.co/dBFk1ULuer @drpolson I think @TracyMo53321503 is saying: tough guy in pic is low life scum whether it's the late Mr. Brown or not  @zadiaz @mashable @at_the_foxhole @TracyMo53321503 @zadiaz @mashable then what's the relevance? @drpolson @TracyMo53321503 @zadiaz @mashable low life scum I think @at_the_foxhole @TracyMo53321503 @zadiaz @mashable still unclear in the context of the shooting of an unarmed teen. But ok. @drpolson @at_the_foxhole @zadiaz @mashable 18 is an ADULT @TracyMo53321503 @at_the_foxhole @zadiaz @mashable I said teen not child but again, how is the pic relevant? @NedicLore good piece of evidence to bad the officer was still wrong for murdering a strong armed robbery @mashable  if there was a black person in an altercation in a convenience store, that totally justifies killing another black person, right? @drpolson @TracyMo53321503 @zadiaz @mashable A black cop shot Mr. Brown if he is charged (it will be racist) there will be more riots. @zadiaz @TracyMo53321503 @mashable Wait, so why didn't we shoot down the ARMED (white) men who shot up theaters and schools? @itsmeggroll @zadiaz @mashable They killed themselves, Thugs are thugs whatever color they are. @mashable poor baby ""he din do nuffin"" lol @Shizz_latin @NedicLore Right now there is only one side out. I wonder if there was a dash cam, was it on? Mic?? That would help for sure. @NedicLore @Shizz_latin In 2014 no cameras?? That's a shame. I see the cams as a form of protection for both parties. @NedicLore @Shizz_latin Sure, but think about how useful they could be should someone be abused on either side.

However, the store vid clearly shows.... @Shizz_latin @NedicLore That is the victim man handling the clerk. The SAME clothes and shoes.

Don't you think? @Shizz_latin @NedicLore Are there reports of the officer receiving injuries? @NedicLore @Shizz_latin Thanks for that. I want to see photos if they were taken. They should have been. @Shizz_latin @NedicLore Release of the dispatch recordings might come out as well. @zadiaz @mashable no I'm sure the violent felon put his hands right up and the evil policeman after 6 yrs of service decided to kill 4 fun! @Copscantweet2 are you afraid of admitting you're a racist?

I'm sure you're ok with that too.   @ckolacia @JHW252 @ScottLofquist @NBCNews @ckolacia guess he can be shot too right? All good #sarcasm @stand4all @JHW252 @ScottLofquist @NBCNews @stand4all @ckolacia @ScottLofquist @NBCNews Absolutely not ok with it. Now we need rest of what really happened. Some of witnesses lied. Some police officers lied too. @JHW252 @ckolacia @ScottLofquist @NBCNews @stand4all @JHW252 @ScottLofquist @NBCNews No but officer doing duty by stopping him based on descript from c store. officer can stop him,if he runs,the officer can run him down, call for back up not shoot him dead. @ckolacia @JHW252 @ScottLofquist @NBCNews @onelove6113 @stand4all @JHW252 @ScottLofquist @NBCNews No but officer ok to stop him &amp; companion lied. @stand4all No one knows the WHOLE story, but we do know now that he wasn’t a ‘Gentle Giant', robbery shows this. @ckolacia @JHW252 @NBCNews Shocking.

They shouldn't have released anything but that officers name. PERIOD. @MizzzLizzy @GrooveSDC wow..so u don't want them to release all the info? Just the info that favors mr brown? Please be fair liz @MizzzLizzy @GrooveSDC they didn't say it was a good shooting liz, but don't be upset that they released more info. @MizzzLizzy @GrooveSDC they should have released cops name ASAP, and also the robbery info ASAP. U can't argue w that @KyleStrunk @GrooveSDC Kyle, the PD smeared the poor boy and tried to walk away before even releasing the name of the officer, don't u see? @KyleStrunk @GrooveSDC I'm not arguing with that, the PD shit allll over this investigation then all over #MikeBrown. If they had nothing to @MizzzLizzy @GrooveSDC Liz releasing facts is not smearing him @KyleStrunk @GrooveSDC hide then they wouldn't have waited 6 days to release any info at all. And they do this after last night?? @MizzzLizzy @GrooveSDC do what?? Release factual info as regards to the investigation?? What do u want?

That's it. ding ding, you win the prize @MizzzLizzy so ur saying if indeed he was involved in a robbery, that info should not be released? Do tell.. @KyleStrunk I'm saying don't release your side of the story, drop the mic and walk away, this boy was MURDERED, IDGAF if he robbed or not @MizzzLizzy well he released the name..that's done. But why get upset that they release other info? I'm confused @GrooveSDC just stating facts @GrooveSDC @thedahlimmama And worse, it took 'em a week to come up with that half assed story. Exactly!

And if it's true, the reaction far outweighed the action. @larryelder What should POTUS apologize for in this case? He was right about what he said about #Ferguson PD.

I'm not comparing #Ferguson to #Isis. I said... @larryelder @larryelder @soonerman_mike ...that you would think #ISIS was in #Ferguson by HOW POLICE RESPONDED.

If Brown had his hands up, unarmed, he shouldn't have been shot. @Coslopuss @larryelder If there was a shot fired in the car, there didn't need to be more shooting when Brown fled. He was already wounded. @larryelder Larry, maybe we should wait until after the funeral to start calling the man a criminal @angryblackpat you really believe that? cops are known for executing blacks in broad daylight right? be concerned bout Chicago @larryelder @angryblackpat in the real world..you go for a cops gun..you're probably going to get smoked..no matter race..stop with the black privilege @larryelder We have a LEGAL system. Cops not supposed to find and shoot the suspect. Even ARMED suspect not to be executed by cops.

The first Europeans settled here with slaves 1619. @angryblackpat @Coslopuss Even Africans held slaves. Not saying it was right. It's just not relevant anymore.

THANK YOU “@LisaBloom: If #MikeBrown is indeed the robber, where’s the red ball cap? Sandals? Stolen cigars? #ferguson” @LisaBloom Shhh! Shut up, Lisa! You're cramping our style! Signed, Ferguson PD @AntonioFrench @BoxxJETSon @LisaBloom red ball cap was in the street. Sandals probably came off. Check out the socks. @LisaBloom @mikeywehling http://t.co/kkYpgP3vMc (Note: none of this justifies the shooting or killing, just answering the question.) @LisaBloom @AntonioFrench tragic that authorities stoop to such depths-shameful. @fwdcrocblu @LisaBloom I think so @jstriebel22 noted. @Voodooempress1 @LisaBloom @goldietaylor no it doesn't @lisabloom @esblima Are you saying he's not smart enough to discard/hide evidence... because he's black? Shame on you. /s @Voodooempress1 @LisaBloom @goldietaylor  Thank u. Now, #Ferguson cops have given themselves time to build a story! Teen w/hands up SHOT?!! @LisaBloom Its the same sandals, his hat is on the ground.  His friend is a liar.  Your wrong sorry, look at more photos and videos. @pink_berry26 @LisaBloom in the street where??? I'll wait @thomasrye @LisaBloom @esblima are YOU saying officer was dumb enough 2 approach robbery suspects by saying ""get the fuck on the sidewalk""? @BoxxJETSon @LisaBloom they showed it lying in the street on the news @LisaBloom what am I missing. What statement came out today @BoxxJETSon @LisaBloom http://t.co/OgE2P6oxxN @thomasrye @LisaBloom @esblima the PD are making this story up as they go along, but they have a few major problems:  eye witnesses RT #QTNA || @LisaBloom If #MikeBrown is indeed the robber, where’s the red ball cap? Sandals? Stolen cigars? #ferguson @octavia_j83 @lisabloom @esblima I'm just glad to see the improvements since the State Troopers took over. Things were bad on both sides @LisaBloom @AntonioFrench ...and ""if"", then why hasn't Dorian been arrested? @pink_berry26 even if it was him that doesn't justify the killing. His life really valued less than that of a pack of swishers. One buck @BoxxJETSon oh absolutely. Not arguing that! @androoshaw @LisaBloom he wasn't a kid... None really knew if he was armed or not until they took him away. Besides all I am saying is @androoshaw @LisaBloom Picts were released to help explain a situation. Some want the off name I and most others want facts / proof @LisaBloom @Anon2earth Lawyer says that Brown's friend confirms that he did take the cigarillos (via. MSNBC) @SloaneBigmouth hmmm cigars are worth more than a human life. That sucks @LisaBloom @Till_You @LisaBloom Facts would be releasing info about the killing, not an entirely different crime. .@LisaBloom wear your best I ❤️ Surveillance tee

#waveday @Till_You @LisaBloom You didn't get any facts or proof as all this would prove is that he stole cigars. Has no relation on the death. @androoshaw @LisaBloom yes those would be the facts I am talking about... Or a vid of what happened from all the witness's that saw it. @Anon2earth  not justifying shooting. informing that Brown's lawyer is already fucking up the case. This lawyer let Zimmerman walk free. @Till_You @LisaBloom Well I think we vs all hopefully agree that releasing this info about stolen cigars was completely useless. @androoshaw @LisaBloom so you think it is him in the store? I can't tell so no opinion there. The Chief didn't say it was him either. So... @thomasrye @LisaBloom @esblima you didn't answer so I will take that as acknowledgment that their version doesn't make sense to you either @androoshaw @LisaBloom back to my initial tweet... What does that have to do with it @Octavia_J83 @thomasrye @LisaBloom he was being sarcastic. chill and leave me out of this please. @octavia_j83 @lisabloom @esblima I haven't been reading much of the news on this. Everyone has an agenda &amp; will believe whatever suits them @androoshaw @LisaBloom no it's not useless. It explains what had been put officers mind. May have been why he attempted to make contact @androoshaw @LisaBloom with Brown in the first place. ""May have"" with everything reg this it's all assumption. What happens when u assume @esblima @thomasrye @LisaBloom no he was being racist.  Not sarcastic and get over yourself.  Your handle was in the pre-existing convo. Bye @Octavia_J83 @thomasrye /s means sarcasm genius. your misplaced anger and self righteousness needs to be put in check. @LisaBloom @imBINGnotGOOGLE they panicked because of the witnesses so they forgot to plant the evidence or couldn't plant it. @esblima @thomasrye so his lame attempt at sarcasm was still racist. Too dumb because he's black?  Go be goofy elsewhere. @octavia_j83 We can all play armchair detective. But we'll impact more change by using the right methods to call for transparency in police @octavia_j83 Also, ""taking my goofiness elsewhere"" is a funny thing to say on twitter. Hope it didn't ruin your day @Octavia_J83 @thomasrye your lack of english comprehension is unsettling. as is your unwarranted aggression and eagerness to label ""racists"" @Octavia_J83 @thomasrye go be bitchy somewhere else. @thomasrye you might wanna report and block her cuz she is on the self righteous everyone is racist war path.",rumours
It appears that #Ferguson PD are trying to assassinate Mike Brown's character after literally assassinating Mike Brown.,"@flavius217 At least they are thorough.  @GenXMedia @flavius217 @rui_xu How? They are giving info that the media asked for. @jlpauk @flavius217 They are releasing irrelevant info that doesn't affect the case of Michael Brown's shooting @rui_xu @jlpauk also wrong venues and in wrong order. After his summary execution in the street, they are trying him through the media. @rui_xu @jlpauk @flavius217 What case? It's totally cool to shoot unarmed people suspected of a crime! @spants @rui_xu @jlpauk @flavius217 and that is part of what's distressing. Police screw up and make bad decisions in any system. @spants @rui_xu @jlpauk @flavius217 to have the Supreme Court declare open season for cops on the population is a deliberate decision. @rui_xu @flavius217 They can't release shooting info cause they are still interviewing witnesses. Media wanted this info. @rui_xu @flavius217 They can't tie the two together cause they are separate issues. Releasing at different times puts distance between them. @flavius217 @rui_xu Are you saying they start at the end and don't explain why he was approached by cops? @flavius217 I'm curious, had the suspect been white would the PD have acted the same? @dissuade p sure you know the answer to that question. @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 For you to declare he was executed without any facts is also as absurd. “@flavius217: It appears that #Ferguson PD are trying to assassinate Mike Brown's character after literally assassinating Mike Brown.” @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 I don't think i did say that. I did criticize a Supreme Court decision I've read many times. @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 and not releasing any facts is a real good way to make sure people pass judgment on the facts they have @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Not releasing facts about that shooting is also a way to make sure they get good info from witnesses. @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 What they did today was also a good way to taint the jury pool. @spants @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu P MUCH “@flavius217: It appears that #Ferguson PD are trying to assassinate Mike Brown's character after literally assassinating Mike Brown.” @flavius217 And that's the point. That's what people are upset about, I think. @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 That's two different arguments. @dissuade it's also pretty upsetting that a kid was summarily executed for maybe stealing a pack of cigars. @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 they've systematically only released information that makes them look good, even info that might taint @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 the investigation (e.g., that officer had a facial injury). @flavius217 Agree. Not worth the bullets whatsoever. @flavius217 @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu I don't understand the double standard of wanting all the info about the cop but Brown's past is safe. @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 it is! I both argued that the Supreme Court was wrong . . . @flavius217 Also per last press conf, local PD depts seem super disconnected and out of touch with African American community. @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 and that suppressing or selectively releasing info led to people deciding for themselves. @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 What other info do they have ready to release? All they have said is this is why we approached him. @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Why wasn't Dorian Johnson arrested if he was suspected of a robbery? @dissuade I believe I read something like Ferguson is 29% white but the PD is 94% white. @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 an investigative report on the shooting? @flavius217 White or Black the biggest prob people have with police is the attitude from cops. We are a guilty till proven innocent society. @dissuade strongly agree. I know policing is a terribly high-stress job, but most people are not criminals. @flavius217 Perhaps they need to alter/improve their training. @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 What they also did was chose to not ignore facts that call in to question the witness' credibility. @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 He admitted they stole cigars to DOJ &amp; StL County PD. He wasn't charged b/c he didn't commit a crime. @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 There are several witnesses. They don't all know each other and they're all saying the same things. @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 You don't want to see what's happening? Fine. Keep being naive. Good day. @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 I see a lot of people making assumptions with limited facts. We haven't even seen an autopsy report. @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Ok, so you get accounts from the community he lives in where people already have a distrust in police @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 and you want to make a decision without any hard facts. @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 why don't you check out the racial profiling statistics of the Ferguson PD? some real, hard facts. @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 then tell me the people of Ferguson haven't EARNED some distrust. @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 autopsy report SPOILER alert: died from multiple gunshot wounds @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 That right there tells me you are going into this with an agenda. @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 that I don't like racial profiling and think police should obey the law? That is definitely my agenda. @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Was he shot in the chest or back? From 35' away or 3' away? Which wounds came first? @Tom_sveb @jlpauk @rui_xu @flavius217 LOL @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 everyone agrees he was shot once at close range and multiple times at 30+ feet. @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 They've already said he shot him once from the car. Christ. @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Right there you just admired they are all bad witnesses if they have distrusts in cops. @flavius217 this turned out to be a very popular tweet @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 No that you see this as a racial situation before you know anything. @FortClank it sure did. A boon to my #brand @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 If he was shot in the chest or back is the biggest factor in who is right. @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 What? No it isn't. There is definitely no justification for deadly force once he was running. @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 in your world, it's cool to shoot unarmed people in the chest, but not the back? Or vice versa? @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Rand Paul, yesterday:  ""Anyone who thinks race does not skew the application of criminal justice in this @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 country is just not paying close enough attention."" @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 If he was shot in the chest how was he running away? @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 If he was shot in the back he was running away but shot in the chest he could have been charging. @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Anybody who uses it at every opportunity falsely weakens the message. @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Yeah, I would totally expect a kid that's been shot to run away, get shot again, and decide to charge. @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 who says it's false? There's a large &amp; documented history of this PD arresting too many blacks. @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Rand Paul used those words BECAUSE of this incident. Just fuck off dude. Fuck off so hard. @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Has that info came out yet? @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 You're making an assumption about something based on other peoples actions, that's my point. @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 confused how an unarmed person, charging, retreating, or standing still, is a threat to a cop 30' away @Tom_sveb @jlpauk @rui_xu @flavius217 Simple: Mike Brown was Inspector Gadget. @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Did you see him stand 30' away and get shot? No. A few people who have a problem with cops did. @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu do you not even have a basic understanding why people mistrust police? @jlpauk @spants per chief belmar: ""a shot was fired inside the car, and Brown was eventually shot about 35 feet away from the vehicle."" @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 that's an account FROM THE STL CO POLICE CHIEF @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 I'm relying on details agreed upon by the police and the witnesses. @Tom_sveb @flavius217 I blocked him, so you can leave me off the tweets. I won't see them, gives you more characters. @flavius217 @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu I do, but do you have a basic understanding of the judicial system? Let's hear both sides then decide. @spants @flavius217 ok @Tom_sveb @spants And there was a struggle inside the car. How do we know Brown didn't get the gun and fire the shot during the struggle? @jlpauk why would the ferguson PD and STLCO PD release the information they've released and fail to mention that? @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 They didn't say who fired the shots in the car. The fact is we've only heard one side. @jlpauk there's a difference between an open mind and an empty one @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu dude, come on. This rogue cop apparently thought he was Judge Dredd and murdered an unarmed kid. @flavius217 @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu So no matter that evidence comes out during the investigation that's what you're going with? @Tom_sveb An open mind waits for all the facts then decides. An empty one makes a decision before the investigation is over. @jlpauk @flavius217 @Tom_sveb @spants UNSUBSCRIBE",rumours

Facts looks bad for Brown supporters Hey, @jackherer20, would you ask  @mbozalina to unblock me? Not sure why she did, but I wanna follow @burkej4 @024601 To the point of murder? There's a difference between self defense and intentionally shooting an unarmed kid multiple times. @CatsAndAlpacas @024601 An unarmed kid who is nearly 7' tall, incredibly strong and was reported to have assaulted and robbed a store... @CatsAndAlpacas @024601 A huge ""kid"" who is then accused of assaulting a police officer. I don't know who is right in this and neither do u. @CatsAndAlpacas @024601 Both have a presumption of innocence. The cop may be a murderer or he may have been defending himself. @burkej4 @024601 That I can agree with but I can not agree with any justification for a life to be taken away. @burkej4 @024601 He was surrendering with his hands up, yet he was shot to the point of death @burkej4 @024601 and because he committed this crime, rather than be arrested, he was killed. @CatsAndAlpacas @024601 There are 2 stories here. 1 he was surrendering and was murdered. 2 he was assaulting the cop trying to take his gun @CatsAndAlpacas @024601 1, the cop is a murderer... 2 the cop was defending his own life.  A big difference and you weren't there. @burkej4 @024601 I'm sincerely curious as to why this information came out at this point of time.  Aren't you? @CatsAndAlpacas @024601 Sort of.

That truth isn't relevant.......geez. @VERPA13 @gretawire but shooting &amp; killing an unarmed suspect who is surrendering IS NEWS ISSUE not to mention #coverup @VERPA13 @gretawire VA issues have been around since VietNam - do you know #RonKovic story ? still happening @Paydental1 @gretawire Policeman shot, killed an unarmed suspect who was surrendering #truth @rissa0425 @JayBally12 I believe the constitution states, INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY #asshole @fujogo @rissa0425 thank you for proving my precise point. Let's let the evidence speak. @troyisakson  If this was some white tea bag rancher w/ a gun I wonder what the would narrative be @gretawire? Would he be a ""patriot"" ? @gretawire UM: Compare the video to the corpse photos. SHOES people. Obviously not the same people: sandals vs tennis shoes. SHOES!!! @JayBally12 @rissa0425 My mistake, yes - cool heads can wait for truth @KatSchrodinger If the boy or the cop was a rancher?  Patriot?  Nobody should shoot anyone for no reason. @UpperCasey Does Facebook Pay You To Post Photos &amp; Selfies? Leaf it will: http://t.co/QEPaYByGRN http://t.co/U1bEY7dbEF @gretawire Tape is from June, not August. http://t.co/SuV5ivTms9 @VERPA13 @gretawire Except he was stopped for jaywalking, per MULTIPLE witness accounts. They were still looking for suspect 7hr aftr murder @rissa0425 @gretawire Racist as fuck, also tape is from June not August. http://t.co/PC1o6DMu8N @troyisakson If #MichaelBrown had been a white tea party rancher, even armed @gretawire would be singing a different tune. @JayBally12 yet we've already convicted the police 4 wrong doing. They're just guilty. Walk right up &amp; shoot ppl. Makes no since either way. @gretawire Even if the incident occurred. $30 in Swisher sweets doesn't merit murder by cop. @Spacemodul8tor @RalphTooRatchet Ok, so I'm not the only one 'seeing things'. @gretawire you being a law professional, you know that's not strong-Arm robbery call it what it is. .....shoplifting @Kush_els @Spacemodul8tor You're not Fam we can smell the bullshit @fujogo @gretawire Surrendering? I find that extremely hard to believe @Pinkomomma @gretawire with the officer approaching Brown about J walking not stolen Swisher Sweets @fujogo I didn't know the trial and verdict was complete. @gretawire oh so this is how America justifies his killing 👍 good job guys @rissa0425 I disagree. We have convicted them for deploying tanks and blocking 1st amendment rights to peaceably assemble. @JayBally12 ?????? Looting is peaceable @fujogo @gretawire I do.  I know Atomic Veterans and loved ones personally who have been denied VA justice dating back to start of Feres Doc @JayBally12 Why weren't both the boys shot? If truly race related why leave one alive. just a waiting game for truth. Sad all the way around @gretawire so everyone here who is saying support the cops what were you saying when Cliven bundy had guns pointed at cops? @JayBally12 Will we ever really know the truth. @Ollieeex @gretawire After Chief said cop didn't know he was suspect ... I recant. @Paydental1 @gretawire Good point but what does that have to do with #mikebrown unarmed execution? Robbery is not punishable by execution @Paydental1 @COACHKtoLA @gretawire and yet the chief of police said i didn't even know he was a suspect and he was stopped for jaywalking @Paydental1 @COACHKtoLA @gretawire let's remember the fact that the cops were looking for the robbery suspect 7HOURS after brown was shot @Paydental1 @xstryfex @gretawire Beating? He shoved him once and walked out  #Ferguson walking down the street is not a crime. @Paydental1 @COACHKtoLA @gretawire as per report mike didn't fit the description but hey just look at the pics http://t.co/06lDuDUzU5 @Paydental1 @COACHKtoLA @gretawire I mean if you can change shoes shorts  hats and lose about 50 lbs in a tad maybe cops should be worried @Paydental1 @COACHKtoLA @gretawire but then again cops in same town beat a man and arrested him for bleeding on them @VERPA13 @gretawire Pigs will do anything to protect their own. #StandWithFerguson #JusticeForMikeBrown @VERPA13 @gretawire Media will do anything to paint POC as thugs. No correlation between surveillance tape+murder, yet was released anyway. @Ollieeex @gretawire Well, if that was the case...you can bet they would have stated he was a suspect before the confrontation as pretext. @VERPA13 @gretawire If they were smart they wouldve, they started with like 3 different stories, came up with this same day as name release. @VERPA13 @gretawire They jumbled their stories and now all eyes are on them. Such a tragedy. No reason for that boy to be publicly executed. @gretawire Incredible. We are supposed to ignore that though. He was a good kid. Ya know, Inside. Ridiculous. @gretawire #whatever! @Paydental1 @xstryfex @COACHKtoLA @gretawire yes homework versus robbing store is prob better way to start ones day. @xstryfex @Paydental1 @COACHKtoLA @gretawire tony, I'm sorry but did you look at this video? Pretty sure it looks like Mike! @COACHKtoLA @Paydental1 @gretawire no it does not justify it but stop trying to paint a picture police officer just shot him for no reason. @COACHKtoLA @Paydental1 @gretawire kid was a thug punk. Resisted arrest, pushed cop in car, went for gun, then cop lost it. @COACHKtoLA @Paydental1 @gretawire that isn't execution. It's a cop who prob was freaked out. @COACHKtoLA @Paydental1 @gretawire bottom line, punk 18 year old man, not kid, should be doing other things besides stealing cigars! @EdRandis @Paydental1 @COACHKtoLA @gretawire I just saw it and yes I was wrong it is him however shoving a man dosent warrant being shot @EdRandis @Paydental1 @COACHKtoLA @gretawire esp because as it has been said he got on his knees put his hands up and said don't shoot @xstryfex @EdRandis @Paydental1 @COACHKtoLA @gretawire I don't at all dispute that, but did he really? Was that made up? How do you know? @EdRandis @Paydental1 @COACHKtoLA @gretawire more then one witness has described the same story In the same way @xstryfex @Paydental1 @COACHKtoLA @gretawire if you know a cop, talk to them, I'm amazed more don't lose it in situations. @xstryfex @Paydental1 @COACHKtoLA @gretawire and if it did happen like that, he will be punished. The cop lost his mind. @Alxandro @gretawire his hands were up; international symbol - even used in Wild West @troyisakson guy was unarmed - guy is dead - policeman pulled trigger #caseclosed @VERPA13 then you must be as frustrated as - and as long as - me. UNbelievable how the issue is a political pawn to love &amp; hate at will @Paydental1 video/crime is not issue now - unfortunately bcuz now a policeman has killed an unarmed individual; armed robber poss still free @EdRandis @Paydental1 @gretawire Freak out while he shot him in the back? Sounds like #execution #Ferguson @EdRandis @Paydental1 @gretawire Petty theft is a reason to shoot an unarmed person in America? Ok got it! #Execution #Ferguson #Mikebrown @EdRandis @Paydental1 @COACHKtoLA @gretawire agree we should know by now the entry point of the bullets if it's in his back the cop is done @RUNN_DNC @gretawire Yup. The officer was just profiling them for Walking While Black. @KatSchrodinger I don't know what tune she is singing, other than seeking facts. @fujogo Cops do not have to see a weapon to justify force.  U don't frick around when wrestling a cop.  We don't know the facts yet. @troyisakson um, can cops justify shooting an individual who has his hands up while shouting, ""Don't Shoot"" ? @troyisakson and yes, thank you - agreed we don't know the facts yet. @fujogo Again, wedon't know what happened. One TV interview doesn't cut it quite yet. But if that's the case, then the cop is in big trouble @troyisakson I hope that's a joke, facts from fox? Hilarious! @KatSchrodinger Ok...bye.  Reasonable discussion isn't your thing.  And hearing one side of the story is how you judge a court? @gretawire Well no wonder that cop shot him 9 times while he had his hands raised.  He was a cigarillo thief and obviously a hardened thug! @KatSchrodinger @troyisakson Facts and ""Fox News"" is an oxymoron. @_Nick_Rivers_  U have anything of substance to add?  Or is this a ""is so"" ""is not"" discussion? @gretawire @KLSouth Greta The Full Truth Must Be seen @QueenPhillippa You mean those useless idiots who freaked out over Janet Jackson's nipple? #FCC  @AnthonyFFabrizi @troyisakson I stated a fact.  If you can't grasp that, there's no way I can get you to understand. @fujogo I think I'm past frustration and fighting for others and change is what keeps me focus these days. VA Scandal should have united US. @xstryfex @Paydental1 @COACHKtoLA @gretawire no it certainly does not. Unfortunately pushing and shoving a man is what started this. @_Nick_Rivers_ I'd bet u can't name one example.  And all news outlets have made errors.  Have u ever made a mistake? @troyisakson I've never made a mistake.  There was this one time though when I thought I'd made a mistake but I was mistaken. @_Nick_Rivers_ Haha.  That's a good response.  Take care. @troyisakson You take care too.  T'was fun!  :) @Schnitzerella @AnthonyFFabrizi Thank you! You got it. Nancy Grace didn't pay a dime for her nip slip that looked delib-er-it. @Paydental1 @xstryfex @gretawire It's the cops job to respond...politics has nothing to do with it. What a bunch of nonsense.",rumours
New link: #Ferguson police release video they say shows a robbery involving #MichaelBrown: http://t.co/GMDuU33oed http://t.co/RaAWvjcWNu,"@CNNVideo You guys are LATE with that video. It's been circulating for damn near 3 hours now. @CNNVideo where is the robbery? All I see is a confrontation. @CNNVideo oh please CNN cut the bullshit😒😒 them dirty ass cops will say anything @CNNVideo wheres the money if he robbed the place looks like a soda in that persons hand😴😴😴😴 @corbinbluwaffle they found his red cap in the middle of the street and thats why people are jumping to the conclusion that it was him Doesn't matter. Cop still murdered him. We won't be distracted. @CNNVideo @Mofochronicles @CNNVideo @CNN Nothing in that video provides concrete evidence of anything,much less any kind of justification for cops murdering anyone. @JMC2488 @CNNVideo wouldn't hurt a fly I'm sure lol @kingpin7666 @CNNVideo smh @JMC2488 @CNNVideo @joefium9527 He din do nuffin, he good boy he was on his way to college, just needed to get some blunt wraps on the way. @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo he robbed swishers supposedly @JMC2488 @CNNVideo I'm sure he wasn't just like trayvon Martin wasn't @JMC2488 @CNNVideo @joefium9527 that's what I'm saying! @thelegendzion why don't they do an analysis to determine whether it's him or not instead of just making assumptions bc they're both black @JMC2488 @CNNVideo @joefium9527 yeah it's ridiculous @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo so robbery can only be with money?Every time a black kid gets shot, all the black people say""He wasnt in the wrong"" @JMC2488 @TheSabber @CNNVideo @joefium9527 That's a defense excuse when they can't defend their opinion logically. “@TheSabber: @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo he robbed swishers supposedly” smh @KoszikMeows @CNNVideo so they killed him for stealing chips and juice gtfoh😒 point is he was unarmed 😒😴😒 @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo word, took a bullet for some swishers -.- we'll never know the whole story though @JMC2488 @1984_levin @TheSabber @CNNVideo @joefium9527 did he deserve to die though? @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo You do realize he didnt get shot because of that robbery? He was shot during protests and riots. “@TheSabber:  @CNNVideo word, took a bullet for some swishers we'll never know the whole story though” exactly they looking for an excuse @Natetastic1187 @JMC2488 @1984_levin @CNNVideo @joefium9527 perhaps @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo People act like he was shot because he was black, but if it was a white kid or a black cop no one would care. @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo there doesnt have to be money stolen/ just stolen itemsto be a robbery, they said it is robbery bc the use of force @KoszikMeows @CNNVideo then why accuse him of a robbery if thats not why they killed him? Whats the point of bringing it up.. @JMC2488 @Natetastic1187 @TheSabber @joefium9527 I wasn't there either. All I know is that in situations like this it take two to dance. @KoszikMeows @CNNVideo to make him he look like a thug ? 😴 @JMC2488 @Natetastic1187 @TheSabber @CNNVideo Unless he was suicidal or something than that's different. @1984_levin @JMC2488 @Natetastic1187 @TheSabber right question who initiated it and since he robbed a store he's already the guilty party @KoszikMeows @CNNVideo to make him look like the bad guy.. Since there is no real reason for why they did it. @JMC2488 @1984_levin @Natetastic1187 @TheSabber ""witnesses"" have about 10 different story's @KoszikMeows @CNNVideo rather he was orange , purple or grey they  dead ass wrong ... If it were your relative u would feel different . @BrwnSkinGirly  Yes which from the video, he looks like thug. They are trying to make it seem like he could have done something to the cop @BrwnSkinGirly @KoszikMeows @CNNVideo It was to show his mentality. To prove that he isn't as innocent as anyone thought he was. @KoszikMeows oh please even if he jacked the cop up they have other weapons besides a gun @BrwnSkinGirly the cop shouldnt have shot him. but just because he was black people care. people kill each other everyday because someone @jarrodrossi @CNNVideo the picture isnt clear that could be anybody @BrwnSkinGirly stepped in the wrong part of town, but just because cop shot someone its bad. get over it. @JMC2488 @Natetastic1187 @TheSabber @joefium9527 I heard that he tried to grab the officers gun? Is this true? @Jason__G99 @KoszikMeows @CNNVideo exactly @1984_levin @JMC2488 @Natetastic1187 @TheSabber who knows this wouldn't have happened if he didn't Rob a store tho @BrwnSkinGirly So if someone was coming at you and beating the fuck out of you threating your life, you wouldnt shoot them if you could? @KoszikMeows he had no reason to shoot an unarmed person u sound ignorant 😴 enjoy ya day✌️ @joefium9527 Well robbing a store is one thing. If he wasn't armed than that could have gotten taken care of without risk to his life. @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo thats not what i was referring to, i was just saying it doesnt have to be money to be a robbery @BrwnSkinGirly Fists are weapons, he could have done anything at anytime he did what he thought was right he has a family to go home to @joefium9527 @TheSabber @1984_levin @JMC2488 @Natetastic1187 you all can go to hell. No one deserves to get shot for anything including @KoszikMeows if i were a cop &amp; he was unarmed ummm hello .. So he must've left his taser in the car ... ? @BrwnSkinGirly he felt threatened so he took action, not saying hes in the right but that what happen @joefium9527 @TheSabber @1984_levin @JMC2488 @Natetastic1187 stealing @1984_levin police wouldn't shoot him if he didn't at least have a struggle with the cop he resisted arrest and the worst happened @joefium9527 @TheSabber @1984_levin @JMC2488 @Natetastic1187 https://t.co/1x92Z7trGu @BrwnSkinGirly the cop didnt know he was un armed he could have pulled out a gun and killed him, if he tazed him he could shot the cop. @t4bithafeline @joefium9527 @TheSabber @JMC2488 @Natetastic1187 By your logic armed robbers and mass shooters would be running free here. @t4bithafeline @TheSabber @1984_levin @JMC2488 @Natetastic1187 shouldn't have stole or resisted arrest brought it on himself @TheSabber @joefium9527 @1984_levin @JMC2488 @Natetastic1187 do you have no empathy? Stealing = jail, not being followed then killed @1984_levin @joefium9527 @TheSabber @JMC2488 @Natetastic1187 killing other people because they kill people? Lol sorry didn't know it was @1984_levin @joefium9527 @TheSabber @JMC2488 @Natetastic1187 still the 1900s @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo yeah they faked the video LOL@your racist denial @JMC2488 @joefium9527 @CNNVideo I don't care if #MikeBrown was rumning down the street with a stolen TV P.O. had no right to execute him! “@PublicOffendor: @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo yeah they faked the video LOL@your racist denial” oh please😴 @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo even going extreme length to hire an actor that looks like Michael brown! Not saying murder was justified, it's not @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo did you see the video?
do you think the police faked the video? are you saying this ISNT Michael brown??

please @Phillippman @CNNVideo i agree @PublicOffendor @CNNVideo did I say it was fake u , are u stupid or dumb? I said why show it now... 😒 @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo that being said, even if he committed the most awful crime on planet earth, he DID surrender. No reason to be shot. @Phillippman @CNNVideo thankyou exactly my point @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo no need to thank im with u that stealing a 80cnt cigar shouldnt trump a kid who had a future. We all do stupid shit @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo what about the FBI @Phillippman @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo this is just the beginning of the information!!! “@usmc1872: @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo what about the FBI”👀 @usmc1872 @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo no offense 2 u sir but unless he was reaching 4 a gun then there was no reason for this to happen @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo do they count as part of the stupid LEO because their part of this investigation too. Video doesn't lie @Phillippman @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo no offense taken sir and normally I would agree with you but their is more to this story. @kingpin7666 @CNNVideo you missed the part where he reaches in and takes these cigars? Passes them to his friend and takes some him self.POS @robert10826 @CNNVideo again he could have paid for them @corbinbluwaffle @thelegendzion They wouldn't release video if it wasn't. Hat, shoes and clothes are distinctive. @BrwnSkinGirly @KoszikMeows @CNNVideo #MichaelBrown He struggled with a cop and went for his gun - that's what got his a$$ killed @robert10826 @corbinbluwaffle the point of releasing the video was to slander mike brown an give him a ""dangerous black male"" aesthetic @robert10826 @thelegendzion the officer who shot him didn't know that he was a suspect and that still doesn't justify him being shot @corbinbluwaffle @thelegendzion HE WENT FOR HIS GUN - robbery or not. Don't fight a cop - that's what got him killed. @robert10826 @corbinbluwaffle here we have a male using a police description of what happened over 3 eyewitness accounts @thelegendzion @corbinbluwaffle Ya an eyewitnesses are the most reliable. Videos dont lie - pictures don't lie. @robert10826 @corbinbluwaffle  where did you see videos of brown going for the officers gun? fox news? @thelegendzion @corbinbluwaffle WATCH THE VIDEO. He's not selling Girl Guide Cookies!! He steals from a store and struggles to leave. @thelegendzion @corbinbluwaffle Videos don't lie and all the PRO-MICHAEL BROWN supporters need to back-peddle. So let's deflect back to Cops @robert10826 @thelegendzion there's no proof that he struggled with the cop @corbinbluwaffle @thelegendzion there's no proof he didn't.  Show me your proof of hands up being shot. @robert10826 @thelegendzion there are eye witness accounts that he had his hands up there's no proof that he reached for the gun @corbinbluwaffle @thelegendzion Eyewitnesses in this gongshow dont mean much. He was portrayed as a great kid. He's a thief and violent. @robert10826 @thelegendzion so that means he should be shot? You're not going to win this argument lmao @1984_levin @joefium9527 He attacked the cop!!!!! @corbinbluwaffle @thelegendzion are you really that stupid?  Blacks supporting blacks saying whatever and a cop -  who's believing who? @corbinbluwaffle @thelegendzion you guys made this a race issue,  to me white black or pink you go for a cop you're going down. @corbinbluwaffle @thelegendzion you wanna win so bad you can't see the facts,  and with that you to will make stupid decisions. @robert10826 @thelegendzion you're still saying he went for the gun when there's no proof that he did i'm done with this conversation @robert10826 @thelegendzion @corbinbluwaffle photoshop lies @RonnieBuford_ @thelegendzion @corbinbluwaffle Lol.  Ok keep stretching for this.  We will see the truth comes out. @robert10826 @thelegendzion @corbinbluwaffle God bless you and your ignorance . Stay in your lane. @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo #idiot @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo  WHY SHOW IT NOW???? because it is relevant you buffoon",rumours

But testimony of sworn police officer given greater weight in court of law than claims by a perp. @LOLY2K @ReleComment @Athens_Grease you're arguing with an idiot RT @newsneighbor: Why was #Ferguson PD still looking for the suspect 7 hours after Michael Brown had been killed? http://t.co/OBWi5VDMBQ @ReleComment @Athens_Grease @MauryCompson perp of what? what crime did he perpetrate? @k_ur_crazy @Premasman @newsneighbor it's a crime scene, if he's dead he obviously doesn't need medical attention. “@newsneighbor: Why was #Ferguson PD still looking for the suspect 7 hours after Michael Brown had been killed? http://t.co/0MnEzokEBy” @MauryCompson @ReleComment @Athens_Grease he chaired a fed board about not jumping to conclusions, maury. please afford him some respect. @ReleComment @Athens_Grease @LOLY2K @MauryCompson you know that's one of the reasons they dq prospective jurors right? .@LOLY2K @MauryCompson @Athens_Grease Not aware. Could be cop car video. But apparently we have two cops swearing to it. Why would they lie? @LOLY2K @ReleComment @MauryCompson Of course, the thing to remember throughout all of this: http://t.co/k5LTA0iqEm @ReleComment @MauryCompson @Athens_Grease the same reason anyone else lies @Leistunghund so now dead people at ""crime scenes"" dont get EMS? ITS STANDARD procedure. They never calldled it in @Premasman @newsneighbor @Leistunghund *called @Premasman @newsneighbor @ReleComment @LOLY2K @MauryCompson ANECDOTAL: https://t.co/8l2KrKDBEP .@LOLY2K @Athens_Grease @MauryCompson Resisting arrest, assaulting cop = 2 crimes. If also committed strong arm robbery, then that's three. @Athens_Grease @ReleComment @LOLY2K anecdotal. Welp “@newsneighbor: Why was #Ferguson PD still looking for the suspect 7 hours after Michael Brown had been killed? http://t.co/GgbkQCPX2V” @ReleComment @Athens_Grease @MauryCompson and you know that he committed those crimes because...the police said so @k_ur_crazy @Premasman @newsneighbor hmmm...dead guy at the end of my block last weekend didn't need EMS, he was dead. .@MauryCompson @Athens_Grease @LOLY2K You clearly don't know legal definition of 'anecdotal'. I've had to weigh evidence. Difference matters HELLO “@newsneighbor: Why was #Ferguson PD still looking for the suspect 7 hours after Michael Brown had been killed? http://t.co/OW5GCzXIkZ @ReleComment @MauryCompson @Athens_Grease i don't believe your claim to have weighed anything. your evidence is anecdotal. “@newsneighbor: Why was Ferguson PD looking for the suspect 7 hours after Michael Brown had been killed? http://t.co/zwVGuIu8bY” DISCRIPTION .@LOLY2K @Athens_Grease @MauryCompson NO. We have solid evidence  resisted arrest &amp; assaulted police because shot running away from arrest. @Leistunghund Good for your made up example. There's a difference between ""no need"" and STANDARD PROCEDURE. Sit. @Premasman @newsneighbor @LOLY2K @ReleComment @MauryCompson &amp; if you *are* telling the truth it's scary as shit that you're in any way involved w/application of laws .@LOLY2K @MauryCompson @Athens_Grease That's your right. Urge you to examine statutes/cases for real understanding of anecdotal evidence. @k_ur_crazy @Premasman @newsneighbor riiiiight...let me call the coroner and let him know that dude isn't dead that got shot thru the eye👍 .@Athens_Grease @LOLY2K @MauryCompson I weighed evidence as chair of board dealing with other legal matters, but same evidence rules. @ReleComment @LOLY2K @MauryCompson Lol wut - now *running away* is grounds for being shot @Leistunghund got shot *more than 7 times. But again, it is STANDARD PROCEDURE.  Stop deflecting and derailing.  @Premasman @newsneighbor @k_ur_crazy @Premasman @newsneighbor my friend the sgt that was shot 11 times was immediately transported..why? because he was ALIVE...👍 @ReleComment @Athens_Grease @MauryCompson so he assaulted the cops in the process of running away from them? @k_ur_crazy @Premasman @newsneighbor officers are trained to keep shooting until the threat is eliminated, it's not a game.. @Leistunghund good for your cracker friend. Still doesn't negate the fact that its still STANDARD PROCEDURE.  @Premasman @newsneighbor @k_ur_crazy @Premasman @newsneighbor unlike Hollywood, there are no 'warning shots' fired. @Leistunghund yes keep shooting why the person is surrendering with their hands up. So much of a threat. Amirite?  @Premasman @newsneighbor @Leistunghund Unlike Hollywood, piece of shit savage crackers are hunting down people of color for sport. @Premasman @newsneighbor @k_ur_crazy @Premasman @newsneighbor hahahaha. Way to go racist..Sgt MacNeil is African American ...#youidjit @Leistunghund I didnt know there was a such thing as reverse racism.  Is there a default button? @Premasman @newsneighbor @k_ur_crazy @Premasman @newsneighbor I wasn't there, I'm no armchair quarterback. I prefer to see facts... @k_ur_crazy @Premasman @newsneighbor dumb@ss, no such thing as 'reverse racism'...please go back to school. @Leistunghund facts frm a department who is known for being racist pieces of shit. Umm ok. @Premasman @newsneighbor @Leistunghund duh and I dont have the systematic power to be a racist. Maybe prejudice. So you go back to school.  @Premasman @newsneighbor @newsneighbor @Nerf_Mittens Because no one matched the discription. But in all seriousness, why? Good share. @ReleComment @Athens_Grease @LOLY2K @MauryCompson Interesting that you describe black witness as ""perp"". Says a lot about your mindset. @k_ur_crazy @Premasman @newsneighbor I really should log off, need tell all my friends I'm racist 😂 http://t.co/sKguZbHzj0 @Leistunghund ohhhh the, ""I cant be racist because I have black friends"" trope. Stop. @Premasman @newsneighbor @k_ur_crazy @Premasman @newsneighbor lol...okey..thank gawd you are able to label me as racist..whew!! I never knew... @k_ur_crazy @Premasman @newsneighbor and this coming from the scholar that has used 'cracker' #iamrubberyouareglue way to keep it classy👍 @newsneighbor  /m qt.cigars 👈 states what was stolen.No mention of weapons used gun etc.So was such violent force needed for petty theft @ReleComment @LOLY2K @MauryCompson @Athens_Grease Police have already said there was only 1 cop there. Btw, anecdotal evidence &gt;&gt; bullshit. @Leistunghund  ..the etymology definition of that word means ""person who cracks the whip"". Its befitting. Foh. @Premasman @newsneighbor @Leistunghund ..and fuck your respectability politics. @Premasman @newsneighbor @k_ur_crazy @Premasman @newsneighbor do you kiss your mother with that mouth?She must be so proud. You've turned out to be quite the racist👍 @Leistunghund K. At least my mother didn't raise a police brutality apologist. @Premasman @newsneighbor @k_ur_crazy @Premasman @newsneighbor 😂 oh stoppp...I'm running out of room on my new business cards..let's see, racist &amp; now this👍 “@newsneighbor: Why was #Ferguson PD still looking for the suspect 7 hours after Michael Brown had been killed? http://t.co/GWvLmzwPoP” #discription MT @newsneighbor: Why was #Ferguson PD still looking for the suspect 7 hours after Michael Brown killed? http://t.co/0mmuIlYxlG @k_ur_crazy @Premasman @newsneighbor wait..this brutality thing..is that because I like handcuffs and stuff...? 😱😂😂😂😂😂 @ReleComment @LOLY2K @MauryCompson @Athens_Grease well gosh, this is a phenomenal point. Why WOULD they lie? @nancyleong @JoeDunman @newsneighbor  Also WHY did the Ferguson PD write a report that Brown was the robber and close the case? #coverup @ReleComment @LOLY2K @MauryCompson @Athens_Grease lmao that's the dumbest question ever asked",rumours
Key point: Officer Wilson was not aware that #MikeBrown was a robbery suspect. It will be key in establishing his state of mind. #Ferguson,"Key point: Officer Wilson was not aware that #MikeBrown was a robbery suspect. It will be key in establishing his state of mind. #Ferguson @tjholmes 👏👏👏👏 #WeNeedThatVerdict @tjholmes So why did he stop him? @tjholmes #MichaelBrown new that he had just committed a serious crime.  That is key in establishing #MichaelBrowns state of mind. Then why did that officer have contact @tjholmes @tjholmes @MikeKrupka could go to Brown's state of mind though? He maybe thought that's why he was being stopped? @Animaleyz not following why that's important? @MikeKrupka I'm wondering if that maybe contributed to the struggle starting? Of course we'll never know the answer for sure. @Animaleyz from what I gather, he was walking down street, kneeled down with hands in air before being shot. No struggle. @MikeKrupka one video of a guy said he was eyewitness, said they fought in the car, a shot rang, he knelt and was then shot in the head. @MikeKrupka OK I misunderstood it. No struggle, but Brown was in the police car at one point. @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka so wouldn't the police car be close to the body in the pics? Or he move the car? @agentlinton @MikeKrupka that's what I wonder, but this guy says Brown was in the car http://t.co/kDQYGHvZA4 @Animaleyz Lots of eye witness accounts right now, guess to your point earlier, probably won't ever know truth for sure. @Animaleyz @agentlinton Yup, I watched that ... absolutely crazy shit @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka wouldn't open. But I saw 2 witnesses that said different @MikeKrupka @agentlinton only thing I dispute is that the police were called, and were looking for him. But Wilson didnt know about that. @Animaleyz @agentlinton he said cop passed him walking, put it in reverse, and then got out and shot him multiple times while kneeling... @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka and I call BS on anything they say, and don't believe he was inv the car. How much sense does that even make? @MikeKrupka @agentlinton he said at first he shot into the car, Brown got out and knelt, then cop shot him 9 times. @agentlinton @MikeKrupka this is the witness that said that @MikeKrupka @Animaleyz so y'all saying 2 different stories. Looking at same video? @agentlinton @MikeKrupka IDK maybe I'm having trouble understanding him @Animaleyz @agentlinton Who shot into the car? I took it that the cop shot into his own car while trying to get out, causing Brown to kneel @agentlinton @Animaleyz Greg, try opening in a browser... @MikeKrupka @Animaleyz the cop shot out the car at Mr. Brown, then got out car and shot again @MikeKrupka @Animaleyz I seen it yesterday. And talked to people who spoke to him @agentlinton @Animaleyz yes, that's what I understood @MikeKrupka @agentlinton it sounded ot me like Brown was in the car, a shot, then he got out and knelt. Maybe I'm wrong @agentlinton @Animaleyz http://t.co/KT5LKYXkRU --- try that link Greg @agentlinton @MikeKrupka ok I got it wrong @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka cop shot while in car. Got out. Mr. Brown then went to knees, shot again @agentlinton @MikeKrupka ok yea but I see how I misunderstood @agentlinton @Animaleyz Not favoriting because I like it, but because that's the account I understood to be true as well. @Animaleyz @agentlinton That's some messed up shit man. Walking down street. Cop goes in reverse. Shoots on way out of car. Then murders kid @MikeKrupka @agentlinton did anyone mention anything the cop,WIlson, might have said as to why he shot him? @MikeKrupka @agentlinton I mean witnesses. Did anyone hear Wilson say anything? @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka he's not speaking, and won't speak. Police department and lawyers made sure of that @agentlinton @Animaleyz Yup, 5th amendment rights; didn't file paperwork either @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka they said today He didn't even write incident report. Which was weird in itself. Everyone should be fired @MikeKrupka @agentlinton by writing the report, he'd be providing evidence against himself. @Animaleyz @agentlinton Yup. Question is, which citizens have video evidence? OR better yet, will FBI have ability to pull up satellite cam? @agentlinton @MikeKrupka one thing I disagree with that guy in that video about is Brown didnt look like he did nothing. Grabbed clerk... @agentlinton @MikeKrupka by the shirt and shoved him, clerk was trying to stop him. But that doesnt justify death by any means. @MikeKrupka @agentlinton what satellite cam? @Animaleyz @agentlinton You don't think the FBI can pull up satellite video of any corner of the globe they wanted to? @MikeKrupka @agentlinton they dont have satellite imagery of everywhere. Thats physically impossible. @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka so is it 100% proven that that's him in the video? Guy in video looks 50 pounds heavier to me @agentlinton @MikeKrupka his friend in the video admitted he was in the store getting cigars, but disputes Brown was stealing them. @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka Plus. 5 mins walking in sandals? That's a lot of room. Plus no cigars found on him. http://t.co/L9HwRk2Wcl” @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka that's BS too imo @agentlinton @Animaleyz It could just be ""smoke"" / lame attempt to shift focus from murder to robbery. @MikeKrupka @agentlinton yea Police chief admitted Wilson didnt know about the robbery. @Animaleyz @agentlinton I know it can be done, but you may be right in that the cams would already need to be focused there. @agentlinton @MikeKrupka witness from the video admitted Brown was there. That much I didnt misunderstand lol @MikeKrupka @agentlinton if the feds could surveil the entire US and world, there would never be any fugitives. @agentlinton @Animaleyz I walk in flip flops everyday, that looks like about 6 - 8 blocks or more, no way that's done in 5 minutes walking. @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka no. The witness said he was at the corner store, not at the QT. Watch again... @MikeKrupka @agentlinton IDK what to tell ya, the guy says it clearly. Just says Brown wasnt stealing. @Animaleyz @agentlinton Not true. Not everything some in open. 

They can see what they want, but they need to be focused on the location. @agentlinton @Animaleyz Yeah, he was saying it was a different store... @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka watch again. You heard wrong @agentlinton @MikeKrupka well either way it had nothing to do with the shooting, so it's irrelevant @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka clearly says he was at Ferguson Market... @agentlinton @MikeKrupka where did the robbery happen? @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka quick trip @agentlinton @MikeKrupka police report says clerk indicated the suspect left and walked TOWARDS quick trip. http://t.co/WcLbN4SARH @tjholmes He left an illness call to take a robbery call in the area, according to the Police Chief. Wrong robbery, wrong robber? Just sayin @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka in the report at 1 point it says a box, another point it says a few packs. (cont) http://t.co/0z8s5osElG @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka but again, stealing cigars imo, arguing with a cop, etc. Hitting a cop, once hands went up, incident over @agentlinton @MikeKrupka police report has zip code of robbery as 63135. Only quik trips in the area are 63136 @agentlinton @MikeKrupka Ferguson Farmer's Market is 63135 @agentlinton @MikeKrupka no I get that @agentlinton @MikeKrupka it just sounds like his friend in the video has bad info of where the robbery happened. Cop went looking for the... @agentlinton @MikeKrupka robbery suspect at the Quik Trip, but that isnt where it happened. Clerk said suspect left store and went that way. @Animaleyz if out was him, and he was picked up. How much time would he have gotten? 0, first (cont) http://t.co/93Um5qJuLt @Animaleyz @agentlinton Interesting. @agentlinton IDK officers responding to the theft say they never found suspect until he was dead, identified him as Brown and his friend... @agentlinton was there also, seen in video, identified as Dorian Johnson. @agentlinton @Animaleyz goes back to stealing cigars shouldn't equal being shot dead, especially since officer had no idea about that... @MikeKrupka @agentlinton of course not, we've reiterated that. But a Quik Trip was burned down because of this, hope it wasnt a franchise. @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka insurance covers a building and the goods inside. @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka even if it was a franchise... Or is qt different? @Animaleyz @agentlinton didn't know it was burned down? I'm not OK with that at all... still not my main concern or focus. @agentlinton @MikeKrupka if you can get them to cover all the loss. They'll nickel and dime away. @MikeKrupka @agentlinton it's a bad situation in many ways. Other innocents affected. @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka I will never put any physical property over human loss. Even a car wreck, I say, well at least you're alive. @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka but that's me. If I'm wrong then I can live with that. @agentlinton @MikeKrupka me neither, just saying the situation is bad in many ways. @agentlinton @MikeKrupka hey is Pierre OK? Wasn't at practice today. @Animaleyz @agentlinton Me @NateUlrichABJ mentioned a knee injury, not sure how serious @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka he'll be fine @agentlinton @Animaleyz Thanks, Greg. @tjholmes  THIS LADY SAYS IN THE VIDEO THE POLICE TOOK DOWN SECURITY CAMERAS WHERE MIKE BROWN WAS SHOT https://t.co/iJBFwbjr2t @Mikeywonteatit @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka so you do admit an unarmed kid was shot right? And fled from where? @Mikeywonteatit @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka and who's account was that? The officer's? Bc there's no dash cam video for some strange reason @agentlinton @Mikeywonteatit @MikeKrupka if the guy got shot and fled, where did the dead body come from? @Mikeywonteatit @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka and as we've seen already.

Only different one is the cops @Mikeywonteatit @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka dash cams still have audio, do they not? Everyone in court I've seen has @Mikeywonteatit @agentlinton @Animaleyz how many bullets did Mike Brown take - like 6 or 7?

Police do go around shooting kids for no reason @Mikeywonteatit @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka and I'm happy for you that you haven't been exposed to this during your lifetime @Mikeywonteatit @agentlinton @Animaleyz That's not true... + the cop had no idea he was ""involved"" in a cigar robbery + none on him @Mikeywonteatit @Animaleyz @MikeKrupka and that statement really just hurt my heart, and I am (cont) http://t.co/Hxq9jvKW0G @Mikeywonteatit @agentlinton @Animaleyz Well, that's the problem... This PD was already under federal investigation for shit like this. @Mikeywonteatit @agentlinton @Animaleyz It does happen ... happened here in HI 3 years ago on street, cop just got off this week, nothing. @Mikeywonteatit @agentlinton @Animaleyz Yep, before this happened, already under fed investigation for racial profiling / brutality etc. @Mikeywonteatit @MikeKrupka @Animaleyz every single witness account is exact same. Only different 1 is the cop http://t.co/evhPAsoBP6 @Mikeywonteatit @MikeKrupka @Animaleyz who didn't even write the incident report of his version of accounts @agentlinton @Mikeywonteatit @Animaleyz 5th amendment, but right, that's why there's NO legal statement / account about anything... @MikeKrupka @Mikeywonteatit @Animaleyz I'm not sure 5th applies to police reports. pretty sure they are required to write incident report @MikeKrupka @Mikeywonteatit @Animaleyz especially if he did nothing wrong... Why wouldn't he write it and give his story while fresh @Mikeywonteatit @MikeKrupka @Animaleyz based on history over last 5 year's, and that area. He gets (cont) http://t.co/gwJzm4dxVU @agentlinton @Mikeywonteatit @Animaleyz I believe, in cases like this, they are told to not write or say anything that might incriminate... @agentlinton @Mikeywonteatit @Animaleyz wait for lawyers to help write verbiage ... but that's just what I recall, could be wrong @MikeKrupka @Mikeywonteatit @Animaleyz makes sense... @Mikeywonteatit @agentlinton @MikeKrupka 5th Amendment. He has the right to not provide evidence against himself. @Mikeywonteatit @MikeKrupka @Animaleyz from what I understand the FBI has taken over @Mikeywonteatit @agentlinton @Animaleyz Given the circumstances, it's a good thing -- unless you're a State Rights ""they can handle it"", guy @Mikeywonteatit @agentlinton @Animaleyz Which, given the circumstances, I chuckle at those individuals -- bc it's clear they can't handle it @MikeKrupka @Mikeywonteatit @Animaleyz wouldn't be so bad if they weren't already under federal interest cases @MikeKrupka @Mikeywonteatit @agentlinton on the other hand, the FBI has a long history of being used as a political tool.

These guys are magicians. @CheathamKMOV @AntonioFrench The American people must take the country back from the police employed to PROTECT and SERVE them (allegedly). @CheathamKMOV @SiDonTrip That is what Al Jazeera America just reported too.

Proof of the slavery of USA @CheathamKMOV @PhilDeCarolis No right, to walk on the very thing, designed for TRAVEL ;) @PogMoThoin13 @CheathamKMOV there is no reason to justify.

It's extremely sad @SiDonTrip @CheathamKMOV so many loose ends and unanswered questions. Does not engender trust in alleged facts. @CheathamKMOV @catann_ So he was shot for jaywalking? @PogMoThoin13 @CheathamKMOV u can tell they were gon tryn concoct a story to get themselves off. Wait 6 days to release cop name then @PogMoThoin13 @CheathamKMOV come out saying he was alleged ""strong arm robbery"" suspect. They must think we're stupid @SiDonTrip @CheathamKMOV yes, the delay and the piecemeal trickle (of unrelated events, even) concerns me @PogMoThoin13 @CheathamKMOV it looks real bad.

An unarmed Chuck Liddell will still beat you to death. @thelittleidiot Even if they grab for your gun? @jdrch @thelittleidiot If YOU have a gun, someone runs FROM you, DROPPED TO THEIR KNEES W/ARMS RAISED...HOW IS *YOUR* LIFE ENDANGERED?!? @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot Categorically for what you described you're correct. But that's not what happened with Brown, there was a struggle @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot Also, I said ""reasonable person,"" which is a standard term #SCOTUS often defaults to. @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot So, in the case you mentioned, a reasonable person would NOT conclude their life was in danger :) @jdrch @thelittleidiot There was no struggle. The armed officer was yards away from someone who was on his knees with his arms raised. @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot That depends on whose account you believe. I'd take the account of an office over that of a thief, but hey @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot *thief's friend, I mean @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot That said, all of this is hypothetical since the #Ferguson PD still hasn't told us exactly how struggle started @jdrch @thelittleidiot And I wouldn't take the word of a White, armed, police officer whi shot an unarmed, surrendering, person. @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot Well now you're prejudging based on race, which puts you in the same boat as the one you claim he's in @jdrch @thelittleidiot Privilege has its perks. It allows you to automatically take the word of the police, regardless of the situation. @jdrch @thelittleidiot Me prejudging on race is waaaaaay different than you prejudging on race. That's just the way it is. Sad, but true. @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot Well if I'm being robbed who do I call: residents, or 911? @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot Who is ""you?"" I'm black. Or did you miss that part? And racism is racism. Period. @thelittleidiot @cdotarthur You weren't there you have no idea what happened. @jdrch @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot You talk about taking an officer's word over his ""friend"" ignoring that there are MULTIPLE eyewitness @jdrch @thelittleidiot Of course you call the cops...and, since you're Black, I know you  pray they do right by you like they should. @jdrch @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot accounts that contradict the story you choose to believe. Are you implying that all residents of that @Sector7CA yea but i knw being a black male , hw ive been treated in the past by police whn i hadnt done nuthin either. sooo @FR_INC @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot yeah there are multiple eyewitness accounts of a confrontation too, from what I read @jdrch @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot neighborhood are predisposed to being untrustworthy, criminal sympathizers? @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot My house was robbed multiple times growing up. I know who we turned to. And it wasn't our neighbors. @FR_INC @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot You said that, I didn't. @jdrch @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot where did you hear these accounts to the contrary? Because every major new outlet I've seen reinforces @jdrch @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot the fact, by way of eyewitnesses, that he was a number of feet away with hands in a surrender position @jdrch @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot when the bullets were discharged. And I didn't say anything, I was asking if that's what YOU were implying. @FR_INC @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot No, I wasn't implying that. @jdrch @thelittleidiot So, you haven't had a negative experience with police...yet. May the odds be ever in your favour, sir.  ; ) @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot I've had 1 in South Dakota where I was pulled over for ""speeding"" coming from my hotel, but I got a warning @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot Aside from that, no one's harassed me per se. But I know my experience isn't everyone's @FR_INC @jdrch @thelittleidiot That's not the same as not being automatically trusting of police. @TallGrrl @FR_INC @thelittleidiot It's a federal case &amp; civil rights investigation now, so we'll find out what's what. @jdrch @FR_INC @thelittleidiot I really, really hope so. In this and other cases across the nation.

No evidence of that. On their knees? hands raised? really? @KelleBelleCa @thelittleidiot Really? what about a rape victim being assaulted by an unarmed man?That may change your opinion.Never say ever @thelittleidiot So tell your body guards when a violent man runs full steam at you next time! #LearnTheFacts before you unload on #Twitter. @LjSmyth so you'd risk missing the offender and shooting the rape victim instead? Way to go, glad you thought THAT through. You're blocked. @KelleBelleCa I'm talking about the victim protecting herself. You block everyone who has a diff opinion? That's mature. @KelleBelleCa And if someone breaks into your home while you sleep you can't shoot until you know he's armed? You actually can under the law",rumours

Controlled flight all the way down. @Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe Or autopilot. But sure deliberately set. @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe I don't think the autopilot was engaged. @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe They're now saying the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane. @Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe That's what they say. @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe The data from the transponder made it obvious. @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe Would be good to get the data from the Flight Data Recorder though. @Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe The transponder did not say anything. No sqwak 7700. @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe It was obvious it was being manually controlled by the changes in descent rate. Also no @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe distress call. I thought it was hi-jacked and being flown by then. If it's true that the co-pilot did @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe crash it deliberately, the whole industry needs a shake-up. @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe It only takes a moment to enter 7700 into the transponder. I've worked on these systems before. @Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe Autopilot was manually changed from 38,000 to 100 ft at 09:30:55 (Flightradar24 says) @marcepa49 The autopilot wasn't set to 100 feet. It was flown manually. FlightRadar24 has made that up. @marcepa49 Have you operated a flight mqnagement computer before? I used to test them. What FlightRadar24 is ahowing is changes made @marcepa49 the flight profile. That doesn't indicate that the autopilot was set to 100 feet. I've worked on these systems, tested them @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe and have operated them in sumulators. Also on actual flights when I've been in the flight deck. @Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe Look at the time on each line. The altitudes are requested not achieved. @marcepa49 But that's the FMC, doesn't mean autopilot was engaged. @Minus777 what's the use of changing FMC if autopilot not engaged? @marcepa49 It changes the flight profile and cuts out the warnings and some of the protection.",rumours

Muslim Fanatics just have a different way of getting their point across. @MajuIndonesia11 It makes them kill. Murder is murder. Whether or not you take a person's head off in the process. @MajuIndonesia11 Fanatical Christians justify killing someone the same way a Fanatical Muslim does. It goes against their religion. @dwh17 oh well some people don't deserve to know the truth @ImmaNavyspouse, not true, no teaching to kill infidel in Christian.The act of ISIS told by their quran. http://t.co/aRXIDQTIfx @MajuIndonesia11  Bombing an Abortion clinic in the Jesus and the Almighty God isn't the same?Both have a book of teachings. @ImmaNavyspouse, when he bombing it, its not led by Jesus'teaching for sure, but ISIS is led by literal teaching of Qur'an. @MajuIndonesia11 I get what your are saying, however, both cases religion is the root of the issue, the issue being murder. @ImmaNavyspouse, You take higher level view, which not objectively explained the real root cause.Actually that's total diff case. @MajuIndonesia11 My point is all organized religions have their own brand of Fanatics.

What's your definition of being Canadian??? @cdnmickeyfan @CTVNews Of course that soldier did not deserve to die.

Forgive him. @cdnmickeyfan oh I get it your definition of being Canadian is one that doesn't include people of mid-east descent #thatsprejudice @TheBeast_175 @cdnmickeyfan I seriously don't get that shortcut.

You hop topics faster than you hop dicks. So have a bad day and FUCK YOU @cdnmickeyfan @TheBeast_175 Killing someone no matter ur intentions behind the killing is the same to me.  U commit a crime, u face the law. @cdnmickeyfan @TheBeast_175 You are not stripped of your citizenship in either cases. @cdnmickeyfan @TheBeast_175 Sorry just saw this
What u just defined is being patriotic. Which is different from citizenship (at least to me) @cdnmickeyfan To be clear I love my Country &amp; the people who fight for it

Eh? @cuba201 that is not islamic... @DELMUJAHID13 @dezzdancing do you know how many muslims they kill daily? @DELMUJAHID13 @cshaver34 @AP yes treat the cause, which is that radical muslims should stop teaching their children to hate @DELMUJAHID13 they kill non believers who happen to be a moslem @DELMUJAHID13 so mujahid if kills innocent non moslem men? @cuba201 absalutly.. the boko haram ideology is poisonous and should be stoped.. But on the other hand the young people are unemployed @DELMUJAHID13 the very peaceful Yoruba Muslims in the South are living very peacefully with their Christian relatives. @dezzdancing nop mujahids also dont kill any human being and i can proove it through (Qur'an 5:32) @DELMUJAHID13 so what is mujahid if they don't kill anything? @cuba201 remember 10 years ago there was no boko haram so why now? the question is what went wrong? @DELMUJAHID13 they were never sent to school by their parents, the North has the almajiri culture, many of their children don't get educated @DELMUJAHID13 there has always been one thing or the other in the north, the current name is boko haram, @cuba201 yup which is so sad, @DELMUJAHID13 the Northern Muslims have always been intolerant and violent, it didn't start with boko haram @DELMUJAHID13 @AP is it a pure lie now buddy?",rumours

The teachings are against violence. @fwhatworld @antonemus @cnni The shooter in Moncton who killed 3 police officers was not called a Christian extremist? @fwhatworld @antonemus @cnni We dont call all those who abused/killed the children in residential schools Christian extremists. @fwhatworld @antonemus @cnni Repeatedly calling ppl ""Islamist terrorists"" when Islam is against Islam creates hate, stereotypes, &amp; racism @fwhatworld @antonemus @cnni  Are the KKK or neo-Nazi s called Christian terrorists? That's crazy! So is calling ppl Islamist terrorists. @fwhatworld @antonemus @cnni Its the words.They r Terrorists, yes! But dont connect them with Islam. When u do harm is done to innocent ppl! @weeshawnaMarie @fwhatworld @antonemus @cnni facts are what they are. Never mind words games. @weeshawnaMarie @fwhatworld @antonemus @cnni Theyre Terrorists who SAY they kill in name of Allah b'cuz of Islam. Wheres the problem w truth @weeshawnaMarie @fwhatworld @antonemus @cnni they r Islamic terrorist when they so themselves.The left loves playing word games.nit reality .@tolovana66 no, but a tree with rotten roots needs to be removed. #Islam @cnni .@antonemus So we ignore reality to not offend? @snrsnap @cnni @weeshawnaMarie @antonemus @cnni ""..if he followed Islam.."" ?!? Have you ever read the Quran and Hadiths? @weeshawnaMarie @antonemus @cnni He WAS following Islam. It's the ""moderates"" who don't. @weeshawnaMarie @antonemus @cnni no.we call them catholic priests,never any problems with calling Catholics priests paedophiles as thoallare @weeshawnaMarie @antonemus @cnni the evidence is to the contrary @weeshawnaMarie @antonemus @cnni the majority of victims of Islamists are other Muslims .an islamist is not the same thing as a Muslim @1summerstar1 @fwhatworld @antonemus @cnni Christian terrorists came to N. America n murdered/abused, enslaved/raped Indigenous/ African ppl @1summerstar1 @fwhatworld @antonemus @cnni We dont say that;we know the teachings r bout peace/love. Words do matter if ur r the victim!! @1summerstar1 @fwhatworld @antonemus @cnni In the name of God, Indigenous children/babies were murdered/abused/raped in residential schools. @1summerstar1 @fwhatworld @antonemus @cnni This is not a Christian teachhing. But they said they were doing God's work. Canada's genocide. @weeshawnaMarie @fwhatworld @antonemus @cnni actually they weren't here, they were brought here. I'm sure you studied history so you know al @weeshawnaMarie @fwhatworld @antonemus @cnni continued: all races were slaves and America was NOT Nearly close to other nations. Ironic that @weeshawnaMarie @fwhatworld @antonemus @cnni continued: ironic that we discuss America's faults particularly when the republicans were forme @weeshawnaMarie @fwhatworld @antonemus @cnni continued: formed to stop slavery that liberal democrats so desperately tried to cling to @weeshawnaMarie @fwhatworld @antonemus @cnni by the way did you hear what happened in NYC with another Islam terrorist? @weeshawnaMarie I agree , the history of white Christians in America /worldwide colonisation /destruction is a disgrace.arabs were big part @weeshawnaMarie of slave trade too.and as late as 1700,s Arabs raided uk fishing villages to capture white ppl to enslave/sell in turkey @weeshawnaMarie my point is that all!patriarchal religions should be critiqued.none should be given a 'pass'for misogny or anti secular view @fwhatworld http://t.co/6doYdetI7H @fwhatworld The shooter was mentally ill.

Como es el tema seguridad en Sidney habitualmente??? @hindelita Hace unos días, contaba que se ve poca policía. La ciudad es muy segura.

Te pasó algunas fotos, querés? @hindelita La gente está muy confiada. No, no noto miedo. De hecho, la familia con la que vivo me pidió que no fuera a la City. @hindelita Nada más que eso. Ellos siguen con su trabajo fuera de casa y yo con el mío en la compu. @hindelita Mira, no se habla del tema. Lo que si puedo asegurarte es que todo esta reservado. @aidapawlak Hasta ahora nunca habías tenido una corrida por algo ahí? Como se vive dia a dia? @hindelita se vive perfecto. Tranquilo, relajado, la gente es cordial, amable. Todo impecable.

Only Kosher outright refuse to stun first. @manjrn @PamelaGeller What are you on about? Blackmail? If there is a demand there is money to make, so no need to blackmail. @BearyTruth @PamelaGeller - Haven't ever seen that. Halal is blackmail by thugs &amp; businesses that buy into it can do w/o my &amp; many others $ @BearyTruth @PamelaGeller - Right. @PamelaGeller @mskimrose Is that why #Walmart has caved to these terrorists &amp; carries halal products now? Americans should #boycott Walmart. @manjrn @PamelaGeller Huh.. its just meat. Not drugs. I don't know where you got that from. Sounds nutty and without facts. @BearyTruth @PamelaGeller - I can't remember sign but look on food all kinds &amp; it's there. Like KFC, subway, etc. I won't support it ever. @BearyTruth @PamelaGeller - Subway won't provide sani wipes anymore b/c of alcohol in them. Enough is enough. @PamelaGeller @TRobinsonNewEra yay for tolerance! @manjrn @PamelaGeller  Reference please. Sounds like cutting costs to me. Availability of alcohol wipes does mean one has to use them! @BearyTruth&lt;• what does Kosher have to do with with the #shahadah in the window?  @manjrn @PamelaGeller @BearyTruth @PamelaGeller - They said that's why they dropped using them. Muslim complaints. If they don't like our country then leave. @manjrn  If they were for staff use,  good on them for providing an alternative. If it was for the customers, that would be ridiculous @BearyTruth - No it was for customers. Also was problems with them serving bacon. Now the bacon I haven't heard anymore. I won't buy KFC @BearyTruth - Their was a list of companies that were halal compliant. @manjrn @PamelaGeller As for leaving the country. Think that is an extreme reaction over alcohol wipes. @manjrn So? That probably also means veterinarian.. yay for me! @BearyTruth @PamelaGeller - You know it's just not that. You give them a inch they take a mile &amp; that goes for so called moderates. @manjrn Coz you hate Muslims? Or love bacon. Its a business, they will work towards the customer base. Don't see the problem. @BearyTruth @PamelaGeller - Where's all the protest against all this savagery. Silence screams approval. @BearyTruth - You can be sure there's more non Muslim buying the goods. It's our caving, our PC police in overtime. @manjrn @PamelaGeller Again .. errr what? Are you taking about ISIS ?! Coz if so you are being ignorant as most the victims are Muslims.. @manjrn @PamelaGeller Lack of media coverage or you looking it up has more to do with the apparent silence. @BearyTruth @PamelaGeller-Not just ISIS but any terrorist activity. Much of the jihadi is done at mosques, ppl know who's involved, silence? @manjrn @PamelaGeller you are presuming guilt by association. Ppl are fed up of being profiled am being treated like criminals. @BearyTruth @PamelaGeller - Your an apologist, we have a problem &amp; belittling it won't make them our friends &amp; it won't go away. @BearyTruth @PamelaGeller - I'll believe it when I see it. Not before. If I know about this stuff they do. @BearyTruth @PamelaGeller - Then don't associate with criminals. Judged by company you keep. @manjrn @PamelaGeller The ppl don't relate to the terrorist. And yet we tell them they should carry the guilt for it. Should i carry guilt.. @manjrn for all veterinarians that have ever committed a crime? Or every women? or Ahiest? @manjrn @PamelaGeller So all American are guilty of killing innocent Iraqi/ Afghani/ Pakistani ppl? @manjrn @PamelaGeller Funny the Christian majority countries are doing all the bombings but its the Muslims that are terrorists. @BearyTruth @PamelaGeller - LOL! Perhaps you forgot about 3000+ killed 9/11. Gee in most ME countries they danced on streets. @BearyTruth @manjrn @PamelaGeller Why is the bombing happening ? Is it possible that it's a reaction to Islamic barbaric actions ? @BearyTruth @PamelaGeller -Why is EU having such problems. Sharia only areas &amp; courts. Women wearing sheets, no thank you. No sharia here. @manjrn @PamelaGeller So how many ppl have to die before we feel satisfied? Gather you have neither been to the middle east @manjrn or have any Muslim or Middle Eastern friends. Or you would know alot think its an inside job because they don't agree with 9/11 !!!! @BearyTruth @PamelaGeller -Look this comes down to protecting what we have. Why would anyone take a chance of Muslim control. Women are dirt @gary5014 @manjrn @PamelaGeller No. Iraq had nothing to do with AlQaida  &amp; everything to do with oil &amp; we used chemical weapons on them! @BearyTruth - That's the wonderful thing about a non Muslim democratic state, we can disagree. Your not being honest with yourself. @gary5014 @manjrn @PamelaGeller 9/11 was conducted Saudi Osama &amp; hijackers.. but we didn't bomb Saudi. As they sell us oil cheap. @BearyTruth @manjrn @PamelaGeller Well , you got me there . I simply cannot argue any point if you want to ignore the truth . @BearyTruth @manjrn @PamelaGeller Again, you are ignorant of the facts . Bin Laden was a big threat to the Saudis for many years before 9/11 @manjrn @PamelaGeller NO, am a realist. The problem has to be solved on both sides. You can't solve with only one party! @BearyTruth - Your right, &amp; they don't want to be""fixed"" they want it their way.

Uber Sydney trips from CBD will be free for riders. Higher rates are still in place to encourage drivers to get into the CBD.,"@Uber_Sydney hikes prices during the #sydneysiege. How is that helping? Giving away free rides would help. @Uber_Sydney thank you for fixing this situation. @Uber_Sydney that's like the most confusing statement ever. The social media department of Uber Sydney is high or something? @Uber_Sydney Trying to get in contact, anyone at the phones? @Uber_Sydney you really gotta stop the swarm model or at least have someone actually look at WHY an area is swarming. @Uber_Sydney how about paying your drivers extra to go into the cbd instead of forcing others to pay extra to travel into potential danger? @Uber_Sydney swarming because of a concert or event? Fine. Swarming during a hostage crisis? NOT COOL. @Uber_Sydney @mtats so is uber paying for the rides paying the drivers? @Uber_Sydney So are rides free or more expensive? Your tweet is very unclear @Uber_Sydney who's paying then? @universe93 @Uber_Sydney calm down its one cafe. @Uber_Sydney what does this mean? that's better RT @Uber_Sydney: Uber Sydney trips from CBD will be free for riders. Higher rates still in place to encourage drivers @EnglishEmma it's still raising prices when people are trying to leave the CBD in a crisis. At least they've made rides free now @universe93 is public transport free? @Uber_Sydney so free or surge pricing? #confused wait, does 'higher rate' mean what @Uber_Sydney is paying drivers? #clarification @Uber_Sydney reports around the world flooding in of your 400% fare increase in response to a siege situation, smart. @alfinitum @Uber_Sydney Yeah I think so. They're getting $100+, riders aren't wearing diff. Good gesture. Poor message transmission @EnglishEmma nope. I respect them for making the rides free, I can also see how they wanted to get more drivers in @DrYobbo initial message did imply that riders can cop hike. Much better. @Uber_Sydney @universe93 so our GOVERNMENT is making money from people trying to get out of a hostage situation but you don't shout and yell at them... @universe93 but you do Uber for trying to increase drivers. My work here is done your honour. @Mr_Odin @Uber_Sydney What do you pay your drivers? .@iGottaTravel @Uber_Sydney @mtats Seems. A global marketing disaster Uber is trying to fix. @nicholasderoose @Uber_Sydney you're aware that this tweet ...is giving away free rides, right? @beck_sullivan @Uber_Sydney Glad I'm not the only one who's confused ... .@EnglishEmma @universe93 Every #taxi can take a M40 $30 discount voucher. But then #guber isn't public transport. @el1nor @Uber_Sydney Uber is. @andrewv @Uber_Sydney the surge rates are to draw the drivers there (uber will pay the cost). No fee to passengers. @bmac_ottawa @Uber_Sydney Ah that makes sense then thanks @bmac_ottawa @Uber_Sydney didn't make it very clear in the beginning. @life19082492084 @universe93 no idea what you mean? @EnglishEmma @universe93 Taxis all offer $30 discount to disabled passengers, #uber doesnt even have disabled taxis to offer. That's true PT .@harrytuckerr No, you refused to pay for them to be at the phones. Enjoy your walk. @Uber_Sydney @life19082492084 don't know if your being sarcastic or going of topic @EnglishEmma You called uber public transport, it's not. PT is for everyone not just the elite. @beck_sullivan The rides are free. @Uber_Sydney will be paying the drivers the increased rate out of their own pocket. @life19082492084 I never called uber PT. Everyone is having a go at Uber but not PT... We own it,we shouldn't have to pay in desperate times @Umair_Bilal @Uber_Sydney I'm baffled by how few of its customers actually know how Uber works. @JonnyPut @Uber_Sydney for the transport service I don't run? Excellent point sir. If they wanted to save money, they should've kept quiet. @EnglishEmma U don't pay extra for PT at desperate ⌚. My apologies if I got the issue confused. I agree PT for everyone regardless of class. @MWhalan for sure @life19082492084 people expect Uber drivers to work for normal/free in ""crisis times"" but when Uber increases prices 2 get more drivers than @NicoleWill100 @Uber_Sydney It is an illegal bloody service. Why don't you thank regular taxi drivers?
Encouraging theft are we? @life19082492084 everyone cries how bad it is... Yet public transport is still usual price and no one is whining at them. @life19082492084 Same people pro do sweet all but moan on social media about how terrible everyone else is.. And yes irony burning my end. @EnglishEmma I see your point. Maybe @TransportforNSW should make transport free from the CBD today. @Mr_Odin @Uber_Sydney That is the point, dummy.

That being said, tell me where Christ says... @JustNathaIy @earthbound_soul ...to punish or even kill those who don't believe.
Allah proves that he is not the same God as many profess... @JustNathaIy @earthbound_soul ...by saying the opposite of what Jesus says.
They are not both bad. @ugottabekidn @earthbound_soul but theres also verses in the Quran that tell u if u kill one person it's as if you killed all of humanity @ugottabekidn @earthbound_soul idk it's just a very contradicted religion to me.

Do other religions do this?....I don't see local Vicars doing this.. @BBCBreaking @turbogeek421 Because its important for #Muslims to be able to define what #Islam should be and not ignore its problems? @BBCBreaking Reality is that most misery in the world today happens in name of Islam.No wonder people turn away massively from this religion @RamShukla_ @BBCBreaking | Perhaps you shoukd read the statement from Muslim groups. A manipulation of a faith statement for politics not on @BBCBreaking Nice sentiment, however the world's tax dollars are being used to fight this trash. #DoBetter @Mitch_NAU @nikeshjha191 @BBCBreaking bullet resistant up to what caliber? @turbogeek421 @BBCBreaking It matters coz now evryone's like;..&lt; #Muslims are #terrorists which is not true @BBCBreaking That's not what the self-professed Australian Muslim leader interviewed on BBC was saying this morning. @youyouxue @nikeshjha191 @BBCBreaking probably enough to divert a sniper shot. Even if it penetrated, thus spooking the dude and he may kill @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking &amp; no wonder many are massively joining ""this"" religion;., those who have cared to find the reality beneath all this @friendsofbibi @BBCBreaking do you have a link? Want to see it. @friendsofbibi @BBCBreaking maybe that's because he's self professed, not representative, you clowns @turbogeek421 Exactly. Sad that it needs to be reaffirmed for the small minded people who will use this as an opportunity to scapegoat. @MrChris1980 @BBCBreaking Then why is the BBC giving him airtime. That's my point. @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking what happend to being able to tell from right and wrong? I guess you lack empathy. Racist girl @BBCBreaking what a load of bollocks @Mitch_NAU @nikeshjha191 @BBCBreaking I would just give the guy his on air tv time, that's clearly what he wants @MrChris1980 @BBCBreaking Are these guys more representative, maybe? http://t.co/XRD3momGaj @Mitch_NAU @youyouxue I found in counter strike, magnum sniper gun can penetrate most of the glasses used in buildings @goonermichael @BBCBreaking at least it's something @nikeshjha191 @youyouxue lol I dont know if Counter-strike is the best comparison. Maybe the cops play it alot, who knows @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking for the fact, it has become the biggest religion of the world and the fastest growing religion too. @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking these grps try to defame islam.they go jst opposite to d teachings of islam to damage it.Islam means Peace in arabic @DrHumeJohnson @RamShukla_ @BBCBreaking Most cases  terrorists harboured by same Muslim groups, who later claim innocence @SIMI @IUMLIndia @friendsofbibi That's Muslims assuring against repressive laws as being counter productive, not supporting terrorism. @Asim_Ctl I'm not racist and hate that everyone who has something to say about that religion is ""a racist""! What dos that make u: ignorant? @Arselona @BBCBreaking meanwhile they're saying what evil people we all are @friendsofbibi it's almost as though the media will pick up any extreme view to create a bit of controversy. But they'd never do that right? @MrChris1980 So you agree that Aussie Muslims waging jihad in Syria are comparable to Jewish Aussies joining the IDF? @thehugheslady @BBCBreaking so you cant identify the paid government MI6 empoyees...100% false flag government hoax @WorlderLyve Why the hell would you join this religion? And what reality? I only see misery, suppression of women and no fun at all! @MrChris1980 Then why are you calling me a clown for calling them out on it. @ahmadhaq @BBCBreaking Sorry not for me. @goonermichael @BBCBreaking total false flag set up by the government @metastructured @bbcbreaking Has it been stated that the hostage taken is a Muslim? (I don't know, not able to keep up with the events) @turbogeek421 Great article on rise of Middle Eastern crime in Australia; particularly in Sydney #islamicide http://t.co/ZFtZoWlHoa … @worlderlyve @bbcbreaking Has it been stated that the hostage taken is a Muslim? (I don't know, not able to keep up with the events) @MariskaGL u see, you're sounding ignorant;., bt i don't blame u;., that's the perception you're mind has been influenced to have @etabori Has it been stated that the hostage taken is a Muslim? (I don't know, not able to keep up with the events) @MariskaGL no, you're just a racist in denial who thinks they're a genuine person lol #hypocrite @MariskaGL ha huh!! and who says religion is all about having ""fun'???? @Shasur4Bharat @RamShukla_ @BBCBreaking @simi @iumlindia |It's a complex situation with a mix of fear and sympathy guiding behaviour. @ahmadhaq Maybe, but that's not what we see. Maybe the peaceful Moslims should massively turn themselves away from these terrorists? @turbogeek421 @BBCBreaking It has been reported that the hostages are holding up flags with the Shahada (Islamic affirmation) @MattBeck22 @BBCBreaking nuns aren't taking hostages, radicalized Muslims are. @turbogeek421 @BBCBreaking The actions are religiously motivated and its important #Muslims condemn these antisocial bits of their religion @Asim_Ctl I don't care what religion you believe in, just don't bother me with it. @friendsofbibi I'm questioning tarring all members of any community with the same brush based on the actions of minorities. @real_dashermace @BBCBreaking Not to hand, you can probably search iplayer for it. @hail_spartacus @BBCBreaking yeah ok. like everything else. there are no bad people Only evil governments. @friendsofbibi because it came across as though you were calling the Australian Muslim community out, not challenging the BBC @friendsofbibi @BBCBreaking no worries. I will search youtube. Keep up the good work! @WorlderLyve You know, maybe we'll never agree, but there are different religions and all are important to those who believe. @MariskaGL lol. Nobody bothered you.. It's actually you that's doing the bothering by being a racist! @metastructured @bbcbreaking If that is the case, then yes, I completely agree! @MariskaGL u shoulda said that to yo self be4 making all those  false accusations @turbogeek421 @BBCBreaking :) Glad to be able to help you clarify, fellow code monkey! @MrChris1980 Both should be called out. Media needs to stop giving airtime to extremists. Muslims need to do more. Actions not words. @Asim_Ctl @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking so if you abandon Islam you'll be ""raceless""?  Islam is not a race, so she is not a racist! @friendsofbibi what actions do you suggest? Forehead tattoos saying 'I'm a nice one'? @friendsofbibi what actions instead of words should I as a Brit be making to suitably attone for my countrymen's mistakes? @friendsofbibi what actions are Israelis doing to show they find all stand by the worst excesses of their state? @ahmadhaq @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking well then you better go on the internet and check again:http://t.co/uZr6EmPNOg . Islam means submission! @MattBeck22 @BBCBreaking well they probably  know that it will be their members that will suffer on the street. @MrChris1980 Depends which ones you're referring to. @MrChris1980 1) Public protest, 2) take action on extremist preachers, 3) take action on extremist schools @andreakirwan @BBCBreaking agreed, so strange that innocent Muslims may get abuse from this but if another religion was involved... @andreakirwan @BBCBreaking ...you wouldn't get the same. Innocent Christians wouldn't get abuse if this was a Christian terrorist. @MrChris1980 Not sure what you mean by that but Israelis protest against their government all the time. @MilfMaster420 @BBCBreaking All religions have radicalism and individuals who do unthinkable acts. You only ever seem to have innocent... @MilfMaster420 @BBCBreaking ...Muslims having to or choosing to publicly  speak out against the actions. I just find it strange that's all. @godsadouchebag @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking just... Stop talking dumb ass @Asim_Ctl @MariskaGL I see a lot of racists like to pretend Islam is a race, not a religion, so they can shout ""racist"" at people. @MrChris1980 Look at reaction in Bangladeshi community to exposure of extremist schools in Tower Hamlets. @MrChris1980 Instead of outrage that their kids are being brainwashed, the parents close up and claim victimisation. @MrChris1980 They deny there's a problem, and if there is it's the fault of the rest of us. Well guess what there IS a problem. @Asim_Ctl @godsadouchebag Sure...😂 @Asim_Ctl @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking wow immediately insulting! How peaceful and tolerant! Logic outside of your grasp? @godsadouchebag you're actually trying to look smart? Lol @Asim_Ctl by contrasting to you, you mean? @godsadouchebag @BBCBreaking 'how peaceful and tolerant' lol you're a racist in denial as well @friendsofbibi yep, so you are focused on one set of people only. Ignoring anything positive and focusing on the negative. Ta ta @MrChris1980 Your reaction isn't rational. @godsadouchebag your @ is is gods a douche bag lol I can't take you seriously @Asim_Ctl  oww i am hurt, i am not being taken seriously by a fool! @godsadouchebag omg please don't call me a fool :( how peaceful and tolerant :( @Asim_Ctl just returning the favor. @godsadouchebag @Asim_Ctl @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking If you think Islam is a race, please show how white and black Muslims have the same race. @godsadouchebag how considerate of you Mr. Genuine, thank you so much Maybe tell the 30-40 people held at gunpoint in Sydney that they should stop focussing on the negative? @MrChris1980 Situation not helped by lefties screaming ""Islamaphobia"" to shutdown debate, then they wonder where far-right groups come from. @MrChris1980 @kmtildsley @godsadouchebag @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking regardless.. If you're rude and offensive towards a kind of people then you're a racist @kmtildsley you're a racist!! @godsadouchebag @Asim_Ctl @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking If you look at the TL of @Asim_Ctl you can see he is homophobic as well. @Asim_Ctl @godsadouchebag @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking not if it is about religion, in which case it is bigotry, not racism. Learn English first. @kmtildsley awww you had to go to my TL to use something else against me? Hahahahaha but what made you say that smarty pants ? @Asim_Ctl you are welcome! @Asim_Ctl do you think my @ is a coincidence?? @kmtildsley can you be my English tutor please and teach me about bigotry and racism as well ?? @kmtildsley @godsadouchebag @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking so... Bigotry is acceptable ehh @godsadouchebag no way dude!! Rock on @godsadouchebag @Asim_Ctl @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking He also likes to call people faggots, retards, and trolls, because he feels inferior. @kmtildsley @Asim_Ctl @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking does he now?  He's a naughty boy indeed, isn't he? BINGO!

@friendsofbibi @BruhnRose @MrChris1980 @friendsofbibi @MikkiL @MrChris1980 Point out what's written in their books and they're own demands yet somehow you're the racist one... @godsadouchebag @Asim_Ctl @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking It's a good sign that a person doesn't have anything to write that is worth reading. @friendsofbibi @MrChris1980 Muslims never take responsibility always play the victim or blame everyone else @Asim_Ctl no need, you are quite expert at it. @MikkiL @MrChris1980 500,000 Muslims can march on London to protest Israel defending itself, but not against Islamic extremism. @kmtildsley @Asim_Ctl @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking that planetary vision at him by is that you? #coolsht @Asim_Ctl @godsadouchebag @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking Nobody said that, as you well know -  a very obvious sleight of hand and fools nobody. @kmtildsley @Asim_Ctl someone is making a move! @godsadouchebag that is me, yes. @godsadouchebag @Asim_Ctl eh ? @Asim_Ctl you cannot tell that from my TL, but yours is very revealing in its hatred, abuse, bigotry, and racism. @kmtildsley @Asim_Ctl someone likes to meet you and be thought a lesson!  Very sm! @godsadouchebag @kmtildsley @Asim_Ctl @BBCBreaking He's just a fool... Pfffff unimportant person @Asim_Ctl @kmtildsley @godsadouchebag I have no problem with people, but what they may represent. @ukipmarch @friendsofbibi @MikkiL because the Bible didn't have similar in it? You bunch of loons @MikkiL @friendsofbibi no they don't you just chose not to see anything not conforming your own prejudice @friendsofbibi @MikkiL you can't defend yourself in illegally occupied land. Get that through your thick skull @MrChris1980 @friendsofbibi @MikkiL Bible changed, Quran refuses to. @MrChris1980 @MikkiL I guess he lost the argument... @ukipmarch @friendsofbibi @MikkiL it's still in there you fool. @friendsofbibi  @MikkiL what, by saying something you disagree with? @friendsofbibi @MikkiL you only support condemning one group, spreading hate. @ukipmarch If he hasn't blocked you, could you tell him that he just proved my point about the left shutting down debate? @MrChris1980 @MrChris1980 @MikkiL You proved @friendsofbibi words. And what you see in Islam is what you see in Old Testament. @MrChris1980 @friendsofbibi I don't see slavery, rape &amp; genocide on non believers in the bible. I do in the Quran though. ISIS proves it! @ukipmarch you need to look harder. @MrChris1980 no I don't. You need to accept that Islam the truths yourself instead of pushing it another way. @ukipmarch @MrChris1980 @friendsofbibi Diff Christians don't go around pulling out an eye for an eye - Christianity is about love not hate @MikkiL @ukipmarch @MrChris1980 Eye for an eye is about limits on justice, not on retribution. @MrChris1980 @friendsofbibi Israel has a tiny proportion of land and used to have much bigger and yet you deny them this I love Israel @MikkiL good brief you really have no idea of history do you? @MrChris1980 I think you will find is you that have no idea of history and would rather support terorists than Israel democracy @hail_spartacus @BBCBreaking  load of bollocks @metastructured @turbogeek421 @BBCBreaking so what does that mean? Assumptions much... @metastructured wrong again. These actions r politically motivated and religion being used. This hostage crap is in no religion at all. @AfrasyabKhan Just because someone's interpretation of religion differs from yours doesn't make it any less religious @metastructured wrong interpretation does. @MattBeck22 @BBCBreaking Obviously you're too young to remember the height of Northern Ireland troubles. Catholic Priests were doing that. @kmtildsley LOL stop trying to cover up the fact that you're a racist @MariskaGL @godsadouchebag @kmtildsley  how peaceful and tolerant of you guys, especially Mariska, she knows all the right and wrongs @godsadouchebag @kmtildsley yeah pls :( @Asim_Ctl @godsadouchebag @kmtildsley In fact yes I do! 😌 @kmtildsley @godsadouchebag @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking you're denying it now? Or were u just trying to suck up to the racist girl?? @Asim_Ctl @kmtildsley @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking you don't understand things easily, do you? We already explained the difference with bigotry @MariskaGL @kmtildsley @godsadouchebag Charles Darwin and inspector kmtildsley over here call that bigotry, Mariska miss empathy @MariskaGL @godsadouchebag @kmtildsley yeah clearly @Asim_Ctl @godsadouchebag @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking denying what ? My knowledge of English and the difference between racism and bigotry ? @godsadouchebag @Asim_Ctl @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking He does understand. To cover his embarrassment he is trying to stone us to death with snow @Asim_Ctl @MariskaGL @godsadouchebag It's like talking to a child. @Asim_Ctl @MariskaGL @kmtildsley ty for referring to me with one of the great minds in history who debunked the creation myth! @kmtildsley @Asim_Ctl @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking he just wants to invite us to a game of nonsense ping-pong.  He obviously is great at that! @NM_Rdg @BBCBreaking I'm afraid so and take your point.That said, heard the terrorists in Sidney are Iranian not Muslim at all!! @MattBeck22 @BBCBreaking And the IRA weren't Christian. It didn't stop until the general public started condemning it. @NM_Rdg @BBCBreaking it's bad they need to jump to their defence every time an individual/group, regardless of religion, acts like an idiot @MattBeck22 @BBCBreaking The problem is that it's ""spokesmen"". It needs ""normal"" Muslims to stand up. @MattBeck22 @BBCBreaking It needed that in Northern Ireland. It needs it here.",rumours
What does the black flag at #SydneySiege stand for? http://t.co/3shTK9yYOh http://t.co/UkVFUgetLd,"@BBCWorld It is an innocuous religious thing, something about there being one god, and muhummad being the prophet... @BBCWorld So it's just Muslims in general we should be concerned about, nothing to do with identified terrorist groups. @BBCWorld http://t.co/tPCIbcJQrn @BBCWorld important point: similar but different to ISIS folks. Not the same thing, probably just a single disconnected nutbag. @havanadump @BBCWorld no. Dipstick, it's nothing to do with muslims in general. @Greebobek @BBCWorld Perverted Vision? They follow the book. Fact is, it's not a very nice book. Hate Speech @rbp77 @BBCWorld It has everything to do with Muslims in general. Are you another communist? You lot are out in force today. @CRAIGPARSONS2 @BBCWorld About as nice as the Bible. @BBCWorld - #getthemhomesafely @Scorpydog @BBCWorld Clearly not so innocuous as far as the perpetrators here are concerned. @havanadump @BBCWorld oh you're a professional troll - in lieu of having an actual purpose in life? Evolve or die already. @Greebobek @CRAIGPARSONS2 @BBCWorld it's a book on how to conduct life, and sometimes life isn't nice, hence why we should pursue peace @Greebobek @CRAIGPARSONS2 @BBCWorld now then anyone else gutted that this is all happening in a chocolate shop... 💔 @BBCWorld IDIOTS! What they are doing opposes the very banner they are putting up! Did Allah or Prophet Muhammad SAW tell u 2 do that? ! @Greebobek @BBCWorld No not really. But then we've grown up and dumped it. About time they did the same @JonBenja @BBCWorld I mean innocuous in so far as the flag is actually just like a muslim prayer cloth. Its use here is awful. @rbp77 @BBCWorld Not a troll, just have a different opinion to you. All communists identify dissent as trolling. @BBCWorld that there's an idiot with a black flag. What is #bbc trying to imply? ""BOO! IT'S A TERRORIST! BE AFRAID LIKE THE SHEEP YOU ARE!"" @o0alchemist0o @Greebobek @BBCWorld A book promoted by a known, War Lord &amp; Rapist. Nice start to a religion @havanadump @rbp77 Hey Ross. How about a bum root? By the way, if you knock me back you're a homophobe. @CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld okay so who was raped and warlord? You've been reading to much out of context material #ignorent @o0alchemist0o @Greebobek @BBCWorld Oh, youre gonna re write history......ignorant? Pot Kettle @o0alchemist0o @Greebobek @BBCWorld You tell me. Are there rules when it's okay &amp; not okay to rape women, in THAT book? @CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld well the qu'ran I read does not condone rape, adultery and abuse of women, the most U can do is... @CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld is use the force of a small stick on a shoulder as a last resort, so what ""rape"" are you talking about? @CRAIGPARSONS2 @BBCWorld I don't need too tbh, it seems your account for knowledge is skewed. I think u need to find better reading material @o0alchemist0o @BBCWorld Hadith 4.24. By the way Ignorant is not spelt with an 'e' @CRAIGPARSONS2 I suggest u should maybe approach someone that is a qualified Islamic scholar, who can provide theological based u need @o0alchemist0o Even this conversation is disturbing in itself. That the ambiguity over rape &amp; Islam even exists, is so sad @Scorpydog @JonBenja @BBCWorld why does the caption above photo say it symbolizes engagement in jihad. @DaveyBudden @JonBenja @BBCWorld because they are misinformed. Muslim woman came on tv HOURS ago and explained that it was NOT the ISIS flag @DaveyBudden @JonBenja @BBCWorld sorry IS flag, whatever...brain is exploding @havanadump @BBCWorld as far as I can tell, the letters are certainly Arabic but they're gibberish, strung together randomly. @ayeshapowell @BBCWorld So you're saying it's Arabs that are the problem? @havanadump @BBCWorld I'm saying in this picture, specifically, someone doesn't know how to write syntactical Arabic. @ayeshapowell @BBCWorld Plenty of people in Australia who don't even know how to write syntactical English. @CRAIGPARSONS2 @BBCWorld and what book of had its, not all Hadith are authentic btw. @Scorpydog @DaveyBudden @JonBenja @BBCWorld The BBC also say that. They say similar but not the same. @Scorpydog @DaveyBudden @JonBenja @BBCWorld  PS yes holding it up for some reason. @CRAIGPARSONS2 last time I checked that wasn't in the Quran, women are highly respected. + @CRAIGPARSONS2 +And secondly, don't forget the bible though it was okay to stone babies @CRAIGPARSONS2 Islam will never condone rape or any other abuse, like I said, opinions of twisted schoolers and unauthentic hadiths can't @CRAIGPARSONS2 speak for a religion. You know the difference between Hadith and the qu'ran right? @bathsaltsniall Yes, and we've dumped that book &amp; become a secular society. And there are rules on rape in the book @CRAIGPARSONS2 I mean think about it logically, how can a society that the qu'ran wanted to lead exist with things like barbarism and rape. @CRAIGPARSONS2 like I said u should get your questions and approach some educated Islamic scholars or theologians who can give u the awsners @o0alchemist0o I might be wrong, but one is written by a God, and one by men? I've no religion @o0alchemist0o well what I would say, Islam has held back these societies. Like Christianity did in Europe, in the Middle Ages @CRAIGPARSONS2 you're probably not even muslim how would you know and understand rules in and out of the book??! @MwattinLeebi @BBCWorld Muhammad and the early Muslims presided over a great deal of massacres, rape and slavery actually. @Scorpydog @DaveyBudden @JonBenja @BBCWorld Not being the IS flag does not means it's not a banner for Jihad. Jihad is pretty central to @Scorpydog @DaveyBudden @JonBenja @BBCWorld Islam. That's the unpalatable truth the right-on brigade continue to skirt round. @o0alchemist0o @CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld Maybe the rape and sexual enslavement justified here: http://t.co/8hAesn5Cai @o0alchemist0o @CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld And practiced by Islamic State, Boko Haram etc. @o0alchemist0o @CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld Also, there is no such thing as marital rape in Islam. @o0alchemist0o @CRAIGPARSONS2 Yea, maybe a qualified scholar like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has a PHD in Islamic Studies. @bathsaltsniall @CRAIGPARSONS2 Why are there Hadiths that say that most of the residents of hell are women who were ungrateful to their @bathsaltsniall @CRAIGPARSONS2 husbands if they're so respected in Islam? When 90% of all murder, violence, oppression and rape in history @bathsaltsniall @CRAIGPARSONS2 falls at the feet of men? @_Maleven @CRAIGPARSONS2 ask that to other men, the bible thought it was okay to stone babies but that ain't none of my business @bathsaltsniall @CRAIGPARSONS2 What proportion of Christians do you think believe the Bible is infallible today? How many even know stuff @bathsaltsniall @CRAIGPARSONS2 like that is in there? @bathsaltsniall @CRAIGPARSONS2 Now: how many Muslims believe the Qur'an to be the infallible command of Allah? @_Maleven there are many verses opposite of that and, as many don't understand, verses have multiple meanings and different interpretations @bathsaltsniall Course they do. It's a religion of peace. @CRAIGPARSONS2 the qu'ran is the word of God, passed down via the angel Gabriel to Mohammed (pbuh) @CRAIGPARSONS2 hadiths on the other hand are recordings of traditions and reports by the companions of the prophet Muhammad (pbuh) @_Maleven @CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld that translation for one is not something I can explain I'll be honest. @_Maleven @CRAIGPARSONS2 as for him, I doubt he will give u a level headed answer in anything. I certainly wouldn't take his word or theorys @_Maleven @CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld your quoting mass terrorists groups that have killed more Muslims than anything... @_Maleven @CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld u can't expect them 2 even respect the religion when they killing their own people. #illogical @CRAIGPARSONS2 political agendas have held back Islam and society, just as it helped create chemistry, algebra, medicine and astronomy @CRAIGPARSONS2 u can check a guy out from Glasgow called shaykh amer Jamil, he specialise in family support and guidance. He's on youtube @o0alchemist0o @CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld Bullshit. Stop being such a fucking cop out. Jihad is Jihad. @bathsaltsniall uh? Cos I can read @bathsaltsniall @_Maleven but no one is stoning babies in 2015. Move on from that one @_Maleven @Scorpydog @DaveyBudden Not ISIS, hurrah! So hostages won't be beheaded, but at risk of death by shooting. @_Maleven @Scorpydog @DaveyBudden Turns out hostage taker is Iranian, so a Shia and implacably opposed to/by ISIS. @JonBenja @_Maleven @DaveyBudden it is just important to get facts right, misinformation is dangerous @JonBenja @Scorpydog @DaveyBudden What's your point? @JonBenja @_Maleven @DaveyBudden  The hostage taker is actually just a nut job. http://t.co/pecok7Iyv5 @JonBenja @Scorpydog @DaveyBudden And has he not declared himself a recent convert to Sunnism anyway? That's what I heard. @JonBenja @_Maleven @Scorpydog So now we have to worry about Shiites also. @Scorpydog @_Maleven @DaveyBudden Who said otherwise? @DaveyBudden @_Maleven @Scorpydog Shiite happens @JonBenja @Scorpydog @_Maleven From some comments I read u would think most Islamist want to have us over for tea. @DaveyBudden @JonBenja @_Maleven I just dont think we should judge others based on religion, race, sexual orientation or political views @Scorpydog @DaveyBudden @JonBenja Get your head out of your arse. I WILL judge people if Islam or any other ideology makes them disgusting @Scorpydog @DaveyBudden @JonBenja bigots. @_Maleven @DaveyBudden @JonBenja You'd probably want to put me up against the wall for being a ""disgusting faggot"" too yeah? @Scorpydog @DaveyBudden @JonBenja Excuse me? I think you'll find that's a common view among fundamentalist Muslims. Not me, you ignorant @Scorpydog @DaveyBudden @JonBenja fucking piece of shit. If you are actually gay, Islam is your worst enemy. Get fucking real, dickhead. @Scorpydog @_Maleven @JonBenja Well why r u disgusting. @_Maleven @DaveyBudden @JonBenja lol, islam isnt my worst enemy, predjudice is. I sympathise with people who are hated for no good reason @_Maleven @BBCWorld please give us your references @_Maleven @BBCWorld you forget the history if the crusades! Yea! And once upon a time, Islamic civilisation gave us Algebra!

How long ago was that again? What since? @MwattinLeebi @BBCWorld Since you bring up the Crusades, how was the Levant, N. Africa, Turkey, S. Asia largely converted to Islam? @MwattinLeebi @BBCWorld Did the Arabs entice the Kuffar with dates and miswaks? @MwattinLeebi @BBCWorld Ever heard of the Banu Qarayza tribe? Or the fates of many of the early Caliphs? Karbala in 680 A.D.? @MwattinLeebi @BBCWorld @_Maleven @BBCWorld you are a person lacking focus and clearly have no focus depth to your knowledge or argument so don't waste my time! @_Maleven i always wonder why certain things were ok for mo but frowned upon for isis? @MwattinLeebi @NiceMangos @MwattinLeebi Like mass execution and sexual slavery? @_Maleven yep...exactly like that.  Destruction of property. ..list goes on.. @MwattinLeebi @_Maleven @CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld which means struggle, if u mean deluded holy war, u know worked for Mossad before this shit @_Maleven @CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld truth is, no normal Muslim backs him, just desperate people that have nothing. #truth @NiceMangos @_Maleven again please back your claims with actual proof not speculation @_Maleven @BBCWorld never mind crusade what about CIA interrogation! #CIAReport @CRAIGPARSONS2 and there are many civilized Muslims that respect women and children get over it dickhead @bathsaltsniall Name calling......oh dear",rumours
